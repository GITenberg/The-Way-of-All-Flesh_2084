<h1>THE WAY OF ALL FLESH</h1>
<p>&ldquo;We know that all things work together for good to them that
love God.&rdquo;&mdash;ROM. viii. 28</p>
<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>Samuel Butleter began to write &ldquo;The Way of All Flesh&rdquo;
about the year 1872, and was engaged upon it intermittently until 1884.&nbsp;
It is therefore, to a great extent, contemporaneous with &ldquo;Life
and Habit,&rdquo; and may be taken as a practical illustration of the
theory of heredity embodied in that book.&nbsp; He did not work at it
after 1884, but for various reasons he postponed its publication.&nbsp;
He was occupied in other ways, and he professed himself dissatisfied
with it as a whole, and always intended to rewrite or at any rate to
revise it.&nbsp; His death in 1902 prevented him from doing this, and
on his death-bed he gave me clearly to understand that he wished it
to be published in its present form.&nbsp; I found that the MS. of the
fourth and fifth chapters had disappeared, but by consulting and comparing
various notes and sketches, which remained among his papers, I have
been able to supply the missing chapters in a form which I believe does
not differ materially from that which he finally adopted.&nbsp; With
regard to the chronology of the events recorded, the reader will do
well to bear in mind that the main body of the novel is supposed to
have been written in the year 1867, and the last chapter added as a
postscript in 1882.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>When I was a small boy at the beginning of the century I remember
an old man who wore knee-breeches and worsted stockings, and who used
to hobble about the street of our village with the help of a stick.&nbsp;
He must have been getting on for eighty in the year 1807, earlier than
which date I suppose I can hardly remember him, for I was born in 1802.&nbsp;
A few white locks hung about his ears, his shoulders were bent and his
knees feeble, but he was still hale, and was much respected in our little
world of Paleham.&nbsp; His name was Pontifex.</p>
<p>His wife was said to be his master; I have been told she brought
him a little money, but it cannot have been much.&nbsp; She was a tall,
square-shouldered person (I have heard my father call her a Gothic woman)
who had insisted on being married to Mr Pontifex when he was young and
too good-natured to say nay to any woman who wooed him.&nbsp; The pair
had lived not unhappily together, for Mr Pontifex&rsquo;s temper was
easy and he soon learned to bow before his wife&rsquo;s more stormy
moods.</p>
<p>Mr Pontifex was a carpenter by trade; he was also at one time parish
clerk; when I remember him, however, he had so far risen in life as
to be no longer compelled to work with his own hands.&nbsp; In his earlier
days he had taught himself to draw.&nbsp; I do not say he drew well,
but it was surprising he should draw as well as he did.&nbsp; My father,
who took the living of Paleham about the year 1797, became possessed
of a good many of old Mr Pontifex&rsquo;s drawings, which were always
of local subjects, and so unaffectedly painstaking that they might have
passed for the work of some good early master.&nbsp; I remember them
as hanging up framed and glazed in the study at the Rectory, and tinted,
as all else in the room was tinted, with the green reflected from the
fringe of ivy leaves that grew around the windows.&nbsp; I wonder how
they will actually cease and come to an end as drawings, and into what
new phases of being they will then enter.</p>
<p>Not content with being an artist, Mr Pontifex must needs also be
a musician.&nbsp; He built the organ in the church with his own hands,
and made a smaller one which he kept in his own house.&nbsp; He could
play as much as he could draw, not very well according to professional
standards, but much better than could have been expected.&nbsp; I myself
showed a taste for music at an early age, and old Mr Pontifex on finding
it out, as he soon did, became partial to me in consequence.</p>
<p>It may be thought that with so many irons in the fire he could hardly
be a very thriving man, but this was not the case.&nbsp; His father
had been a day labourer, and he had himself begun life with no other
capital than his good sense and good constitution; now, however, there
was a goodly show of timber about his yard, and a look of solid comfort
over his whole establishment.&nbsp; Towards the close of the eighteenth
century and not long before my father came to Paleham, he had taken
a farm of about ninety acres, thus making a considerable rise in life.&nbsp;
Along with the farm there went an old-fashioned but comfortable house
with a charming garden and an orchard.&nbsp; The carpenter&rsquo;s business
was now carried on in one of the outhouses that had once been part of
some conventual buildings, the remains of which could be seen in what
was called the Abbey Close.&nbsp; The house itself, embosomed in honeysuckles
and creeping roses, was an ornament to the whole village, nor were its
internal arrangements less exemplary than its outside was ornamental.&nbsp;
Report said that Mrs Pontifex starched the sheets for her best bed,
and I can well believe it.</p>
<p>How well do I remember her parlour half filled with the organ which
her husband had built, and scented with a withered apple or two from
the <i>pyrus japonica</i> that grew outside the house; the picture of
the prize ox over the chimney-piece, which Mr Pontifex himself had painted;
the transparency of the man coming to show light to a coach upon a snowy
night, also by Mr Pontifex; the little old man and little old woman
who told the weather; the china shepherd and shepherdess; the jars of
feathery flowering grasses with a peacock&rsquo;s feather or two among
them to set them off, and the china bowls full of dead rose leaves dried
with bay salt.&nbsp; All has long since vanished and become a memory,
faded but still fragrant to myself.</p>
<p>Nay, but her kitchen&mdash;and the glimpses into a cavernous cellar
beyond it, wherefrom came gleams from the pale surfaces of milk cans,
or it may be of the arms and face of a milkmaid skimming the cream;
or again her storeroom, where among other treasures she kept the famous
lipsalve which was one of her especial glories, and of which she would
present a shape yearly to those whom she delighted to honour.&nbsp;
She wrote out the recipe for this and gave it to my mother a year or
two before she died, but we could never make it as she did.&nbsp; When
we were children she used sometimes to send her respects to my mother,
and ask leave for us to come and take tea with her.&nbsp; Right well
she used to ply us.&nbsp; As for her temper, we never met such a delightful
old lady in our lives; whatever Mr Pontifex may have had to put up with,
we had no cause for complaint, and then Mr Pontifex would play to us
upon the organ, and we would stand round him open-mouthed and think
him the most wonderfully clever man that ever was born, except of course
our papa.</p>
<p>Mrs Pontifex had no sense of humour, at least I can call to mind
no signs of this, but her husband had plenty of fun in him, though few
would have guessed it from his appearance.&nbsp; I remember my father
once sent me down to his workship to get some glue, and I happened to
come when old Pontifex was in the act of scolding his boy.&nbsp; He
had got the lad&mdash;a pudding-headed fellow&mdash;by the ear and was
saying, &ldquo;What?&nbsp; Lost again&mdash;smothered o&rsquo; wit.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(I believe it was the boy who was himself supposed to be a wandering
soul, and who was thus addressed as lost.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, look here,
my lad,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;some boys are born stupid, and thou
art one of them; some achieve stupidity&mdash;that&rsquo;s thee again,
Jim&mdash;thou wast both born stupid and hast greatly increased thy
birthright&mdash;and some&rdquo; (and here came a climax during which
the boy&rsquo;s head and ear were swayed from side to side) &ldquo;have
stupidity thrust upon them, which, if it please the Lord, shall not
be thy case, my lad, for I will thrust stupidity from thee, though I
have to box thine ears in doing so,&rdquo; but I did not see that the
old man really did box Jim&rsquo;s ears, or do more than pretend to
frighten him, for the two understood one another perfectly well.&nbsp;
Another time I remember hearing him call the village rat-catcher by
saying, &ldquo;Come hither, thou three-days-and-three-nights, thou,&rdquo;
alluding, as I afterwards learned, to the rat-catcher&rsquo;s periods
of intoxication; but I will tell no more of such trifles.&nbsp; My father&rsquo;s
face would always brighten when old Pontifex&rsquo;s name was mentioned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I tell you, Edward,&rdquo; he would say to me, &ldquo;old Pontifex
was not only an able man, but he was one of the very ablest men that
ever I knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was more than I as a young man was prepared to stand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My dear father,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;what did he do?&nbsp;
He could draw a little, but could he to save his life have got a picture
into the Royal Academy exhibition?&nbsp; He built two organs and could
play the Minuet in <i>Samson</i> on one and the March in <i>Scipio</i>
on the other; he was a good carpenter and a bit of a wag; he was a good
old fellow enough, but why make him out so much abler than he was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; returned my father, &ldquo;you must not judge
by the work, but by the work in connection with the surroundings.&nbsp;
Could Giotto or Filippo Lippi, think you, have got a picture into the
Exhibition?&nbsp; Would a single one of those frescoes we went to see
when we were at Padua have the remotest chance of being hung, if it
were sent in for exhibition now?&nbsp; Why, the Academy people would
be so outraged that they would not even write to poor Giotto to tell
him to come and take his fresco away.&nbsp; Phew!&rdquo; continued he,
waxing warm, &ldquo;if old Pontifex had had Cromwell&rsquo;s chances
he would have done all that Cromwell did, and have done it better; if
he had had Giotto&rsquo;s chances he would have done all that Giotto
did, and done it no worse; as it was, he was a village carpenter, and
I will undertake to say he never scamped a job in the whole course of
his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we cannot judge people with so
many &lsquo;ifs.&rsquo;&nbsp; If old Pontifex had lived in Giotto&rsquo;s
time he might have been another Giotto, but he did not live in Giotto&rsquo;s
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Edward,&rdquo; said my father with some severity,
&ldquo;we must judge men not so much by what they do, as by what they
make us feel that they have it in them to do.&nbsp; If a man has done
enough either in painting, music or the affairs of life, to make me
feel that I might trust him in an emergency he has done enough.&nbsp;
It is not by what a man has actually put upon his canvas, nor yet by
the acts which he has set down, so to speak, upon the canvas of his
life that I will judge him, but by what he makes me feel that he felt
and aimed at.&nbsp; If he has made me feel that he felt those things
to be loveable which I hold loveable myself I ask no more; his grammar
may have been imperfect, but still I have understood him; he and I are
<i>en rapport</i>; and I say again, Edward, that old Pontifex was not
only an able man, but one of the very ablest men I ever knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Against this there was no more to be said, and my sisters eyed me
to silence.&nbsp; Somehow or other my sisters always did eye me to silence
when I differed from my father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk of his successful son,&rdquo; snorted my father, whom
I had fairly roused.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is not fit to black his father&rsquo;s
boots.&nbsp; He has his thousands of pounds a year, while his father
had perhaps three thousand shillings a year towards the end of his life.&nbsp;
He <i>is</i> a successful man; but his father, hobbling about Paleham
Street in his grey worsted stockings, broad brimmed hat and brown swallow-tailed
coat was worth a hundred of George Pontifexes, for all his carriages
and horses and the airs he gives himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But yet,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;George Pontifex is no fool
either.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this brings us to the second generation of
the Pontifex family with whom we need concern ourselves.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>Old Mr Pontifex had married in the year 1750, but for fifteen years
his wife bore no children.&nbsp; At the end of that time Mrs Pontifex
astonished the whole village by showing unmistakable signs of a disposition
to present her husband with an heir or heiress.&nbsp; Hers had long
ago been considered a hopeless case, and when on consulting the doctor
concerning the meaning of certain symptoms she was informed of their
significance, she became very angry and abused the doctor roundly for
talking nonsense.&nbsp; She refused to put so much as a piece of thread
into a needle in anticipation of her confinement and would have been
absolutely unprepared, if her neighbours had not been better judges
of her condition than she was, and got things ready without telling
her anything about it.&nbsp; Perhaps she feared Nemesis, though assuredly
she knew not who or what Nemesis was; perhaps she feared the doctor
had made a mistake and she should be laughed at; from whatever cause,
however, her refusal to recognise the obvious arose, she certainly refused
to recognise it, until one snowy night in January the doctor was sent
for with all urgent speed across the rough country roads.&nbsp; When
he arrived he found two patients, not one, in need of his assistance,
for a boy had been born who was in due time christened George, in honour
of his then reigning majesty.</p>
<p>To the best of my belief George Pontifex got the greater part of
his nature from this obstinate old lady, his mother&mdash;a mother who
though she loved no one else in the world except her husband (and him
only after a fashion) was most tenderly attached to the unexpected child
of her old age; nevertheless she showed it little.</p>
<p>The boy grew up into a sturdy bright-eyed little fellow, with plenty
of intelligence, and perhaps a trifle too great readiness at book learning.&nbsp;
Being kindly treated at home, he was as fond of his father and mother
as it was in his nature to be of anyone, but he was fond of no one else.&nbsp;
He had a good healthy sense of <i>meum</i>, and as little of <i>tuum</i>
as he could help.&nbsp; Brought up much in the open air in one of the
best situated and healthiest villages in England, his little limbs had
fair play, and in those days children&rsquo;s brains were not overtasked
as they now are; perhaps it was for this very reason that the boy showed
an avidity to learn.&nbsp; At seven or eight years old he could read,
write and sum better than any other boy of his age in the village.&nbsp;
My father was not yet rector of Paleham, and did not remember George
Pontifex&rsquo;s childhood, but I have heard neighbours tell him that
the boy was looked upon as unusually quick and forward.&nbsp; His father
and mother were naturally proud of their offspring, and his mother was
determined that he should one day become one of the kings and councillors
of the earth.</p>
<p>It is one thing however to resolve that one&rsquo;s son shall win
some of life&rsquo;s larger prizes, and another to square matters with
fortune in this respect.&nbsp; George Pontifex might have been brought
up as a carpenter and succeeded in no other way than as succeeding his
father as one of the minor magnates of Paleham, and yet have been a
more truly successful man than he actually was&mdash;for I take it there
is not much more solid success in this world than what fell to the lot
of old Mr and Mrs Pontifex; it happened, however, that about the year
1780, when George was a boy of fifteen, a sister of Mrs Pontifex&rsquo;s,
who had married a Mr Fairlie, came to pay a few days&rsquo; visit at
Paleham.&nbsp; Mr Fairlie was a publisher, chiefly of religious works,
and had an establishment in Paternoster Row; he had risen in life, and
his wife had risen with him.&nbsp; No very close relations had been
maintained between the sisters for some years, and I forget exactly
how it came about that Mr and Mrs Fairlie were guests in the quiet but
exceedingly comfortable house of their sister and brother-in-law; but
for some reason or other the visit was paid, and little George soon
succeeded in making his way into his uncle and aunt&rsquo;s good graces.&nbsp;
A quick, intelligent boy with a good address, a sound constitution,
and coming of respectable parents, has a potential value which a practised
business man who has need of many subordinates is little likely to overlook.&nbsp;
Before his visit was over Mr Fairlie proposed to the lad&rsquo;s father
and mother that he should put him into his own business, at the same
time promising that if the boy did well he should not want some one
to bring him forward.&nbsp; Mrs Pontifex had her son&rsquo;s interest
too much at heart to refuse such an offer, so the matter was soon arranged,
and about a fortnight after the Fairlies had left, George was sent up
by coach to London, where he was met by his uncle and aunt, with whom
it was arranged that he should live.</p>
<p>This was George&rsquo;s great start in life.&nbsp; He now wore more
fashionable clothes than he had yet been accustomed to, and any little
rusticity of gait or pronunciation which he had brought from Paleham,
was so quickly and completely lost that it was ere long impossible to
detect that he had not been born and bred among people of what is commonly
called education.&nbsp; The boy paid great attention to his work, and
more than justified the favourable opinion which Mr Fairlie had formed
concerning him.&nbsp; Sometimes Mr Fairlie would send him down to Paleham
for a few days&rsquo; holiday, and ere long his parents perceived that
he had acquired an air and manner of talking different from any that
he had taken with him from Paleham.&nbsp; They were proud of him, and
soon fell into their proper places, resigning all appearance of a parental
control, for which indeed there was no kind of necessity.&nbsp; In return,
George was always kindly to them, and to the end of his life retained
a more affectionate feeling towards his father and mother than I imagine
him ever to have felt again for man, woman, or child.</p>
<p>George&rsquo;s visits to Paleham were never long, for the distance
from London was under fifty miles and there was a direct coach, so that
the journey was easy; there was not time, therefore, for the novelty
to wear off either on the part of the young man or of his parents.&nbsp;
George liked the fresh country air and green fields after the darkness
to which he had been so long accustomed in Paternoster Row, which then,
as now, was a narrow gloomy lane rather than a street.&nbsp; Independently
of the pleasure of seeing the familiar faces of the farmers and villagers,
he liked also being seen and being congratulated on growing up such
a fine-looking and fortunate young fellow, for he was not the youth
to hide his light under a bushel.&nbsp; His uncle had had him taught
Latin and Greek of an evening; he had taken kindly to these languages
and had rapidly and easily mastered what many boys take years in acquiring.&nbsp;
I suppose his knowledge gave him a self-confidence which made itself
felt whether he intended it or not; at any rate, he soon began to pose
as a judge of literature, and from this to being a judge of art, architecture,
music and everything else, the path was easy.&nbsp; Like his father,
he knew the value of money, but he was at once more ostentatious and
less liberal than his father; while yet a boy he was a thorough little
man of the world, and did well rather upon principles which he had tested
by personal experiment, and recognised as principles, than from those
profounder convictions which in his father were so instinctive that
he could give no account concerning them.</p>
<p>His father, as I have said, wondered at him and let him alone.&nbsp;
His son had fairly distanced him, and in an inarticulate way the father
knew it perfectly well.&nbsp; After a few years he took to wearing his
best clothes whenever his son came to stay with him, nor would he discard
them for his ordinary ones till the young man had returned to London.&nbsp;
I believe old Mr Pontifex, along with his pride and affection, felt
also a certain fear of his son, as though of something which he could
not thoroughly understand, and whose ways, notwithstanding outward agreement,
were nevertheless not as his ways.&nbsp; Mrs Pontifex felt nothing of
this; to her George was pure and absolute perfection, and she saw, or
thought she saw, with pleasure, that he resembled her and her family
in feature as well as in disposition rather than her husband and his.</p>
<p>When George was about twenty-five years old his uncle took him into
partnership on very liberal terms.&nbsp; He had little cause to regret
this step.&nbsp; The young man infused fresh vigour into a concern that
was already vigorous, and by the time he was thirty found himself in
the receipt of not less than &pound;1500 a year as his share of the
profits.&nbsp; Two years later he married a lady about seven years younger
than himself, who brought him a handsome dowry.&nbsp; She died in 1805,
when her youngest child Alethea was born, and her husband did not marry
again.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>In the early years of the century five little children and a couple
of nurses began to make periodical visits to Paleham.&nbsp; It is needless
to say they were a rising generation of Pontifexes, towards whom the
old couple, their grandparents, were as tenderly deferential as they
would have been to the children of the Lord Lieutenant of the County.&nbsp;
Their names were Eliza, Maria, John, Theobald (who like myself was born
in 1802), and Alethea.&nbsp; Mr Pontifex always put the prefix &ldquo;master&rdquo;
or &ldquo;miss&rdquo; before the names of his grandchildren, except
in the case of Alethea, who was his favourite.&nbsp; To have resisted
his grandchildren would have been as impossible for him as to have resisted
his wife; even old Mrs Pontifex yielded before her son&rsquo;s children,
and gave them all manner of licence which she would never have allowed
even to my sisters and myself, who stood next in her regard.&nbsp; Two
regulations only they must attend to; they must wipe their shoes well
on coming into the house, and they must not overfeed Mr Pontifex&rsquo;s
organ with wind, nor take the pipes out.</p>
<p>By us at the Rectory there was no time so much looked forward to
as the annual visit of the little Pontifexes to Paleham.&nbsp; We came
in for some of the prevailing licence; we went to tea with Mrs Pontifex
to meet her grandchildren, and then our young friends were asked to
the Rectory to have tea with us, and we had what we considered great
times.&nbsp; I fell desperately in love with Alethea, indeed we all
fell in love with each other, plurality and exchange whether of wives
or husbands being openly and unblushingly advocated in the very presence
of our nurses.&nbsp; We were very merry, but it is so long ago that
I have forgotten nearly everything save that we <i>were</i> very merry.&nbsp;
Almost the only thing that remains with me as a permanent impression
was the fact that Theobald one day beat his nurse and teased her, and
when she said she should go away cried out, &ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t
go away&mdash;I&rsquo;ll keep you on purpose to torment you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One winter&rsquo;s morning, however, in the year 1811, we heard the
church bell tolling while we were dressing in the back nursery and were
told it was for old Mrs Pontifex.&nbsp; Our man-servant John told us
and added with grim levity that they were ringing the bell to come and
take her away.&nbsp; She had had a fit of paralysis which had carried
her off quite suddenly.&nbsp; It was very shocking, the more so because
our nurse assured us that if God chose we might all have fits of paralysis
ourselves that very day and be taken straight off to the Day of Judgement.&nbsp;
The Day of Judgement indeed, according to the opinion of those who were
most likely to know, would not under any circumstances be delayed more
than a few years longer, and then the whole world would be burned, and
we ourselves be consigned to an eternity of torture, unless we mended
our ways more than we at present seemed at all likely to do.&nbsp; All
this was so alarming that we fell to screaming and made such a hullabaloo
that the nurse was obliged for her own peace to reassure us.&nbsp; Then
we wept, but more composedly, as we remembered that there would be no
more tea and cakes for us now at old Mrs Pontifex&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>On the day of the funeral, however, we had a great excitement; old
Mr Pontifex sent round a penny loaf to every inhabitant of the village
according to a custom still not uncommon at the beginning of the century;
the loaf was called a dole.&nbsp; We had never heard of this custom
before, besides, though we had often heard of penny loaves, we had never
before seen one; moreover, they were presents to us as inhabitants of
the village, and we were treated as grown up people, for our father
and mother and the servants had each one loaf sent them, but only one.&nbsp;
We had never yet suspected that we were inhabitants at all; finally,
the little loaves were new, and we were passionately fond of new bread,
which we were seldom or never allowed to have, as it was supposed not
to be good for us.&nbsp; Our affection, therefore, for our old friend
had to stand against the combined attacks of arch&aelig;ological interest,
the rights of citizenship and property, the pleasantness to the eye
and goodness for food of the little loaves themselves, and the sense
of importance which was given us by our having been intimate with someone
who had actually died.&nbsp; It seemed upon further inquiry that there
was little reason to anticipate an early death for anyone of ourselves,
and this being so, we rather liked the idea of someone else&rsquo;s
being put away into the churchyard; we passed, therefore, in a short
time from extreme depression to a no less extreme exultation; a new
heaven and a new earth had been revealed to us in our perception of
the possibility of benefiting by the death of our friends, and I fear
that for some time we took an interest in the health of everyone in
the village whose position rendered a repetition of the dole in the
least likely.</p>
<p>Those were the days in which all great things seemed far off, and
we were astonished to find that Napoleon Buonaparte was an actually
living person.&nbsp; We had thought such a great man could only have
lived a very long time ago, and here he was after all almost as it were
at our own doors.&nbsp; This lent colour to the view that the Day of
Judgement might indeed be nearer than we had thought, but nurse said
that was all right now, and she knew.&nbsp; In those days the snow lay
longer and drifted deeper in the lanes than it does now, and the milk
was sometimes brought in frozen in winter, and we were taken down into
the back kitchen to see it.&nbsp; I suppose there are rectories up and
down the country now where the milk comes in frozen sometimes in winter,
and the children go down to wonder at it, but I never see any frozen
milk in London, so I suppose the winters are warmer than they used to
be.</p>
<p>About one year after his wife&rsquo;s death Mr Pontifex also was
gathered to his fathers.&nbsp; My father saw him the day before he died.&nbsp;
The old man had a theory about sunsets, and had had two steps built
up against a wall in the kitchen garden on which he used to stand and
watch the sun go down whenever it was clear.&nbsp; My father came on
him in the afternoon, just as the sun was setting, and saw him with
his arms resting on the top of the wall looking towards the sun over
a field through which there was a path on which my father was.&nbsp;
My father heard him say &ldquo;Good-bye, sun; good-bye, sun,&rdquo;
as the sun sank, and saw by his tone and manner that he was feeling
very feeble.&nbsp; Before the next sunset he was gone.</p>
<p>There was no dole.&nbsp; Some of his grandchildren were brought to
the funeral and we remonstrated with them, but did not take much by
doing so.&nbsp; John Pontifex, who was a year older than I was, sneered
at penny loaves, and intimated that if I wanted one it must be because
my papa and mamma could not afford to buy me one, whereon I believe
we did something like fighting, and I rather think John Pontifex got
the worst of it, but it may have been the other way.&nbsp; I remember
my sister&rsquo;s nurse, for I was just outgrowing nurses myself, reported
the matter to higher quarters, and we were all of us put to some ignominy,
but we had been thoroughly awakened from our dream, and it was long
enough before we could hear the words &ldquo;penny loaf&rdquo; mentioned
without our ears tingling with shame.&nbsp; If there had been a dozen
doles afterwards we should not have deigned to touch one of them.</p>
<p>George Pontifex put up a monument to his parents, a plain slab in
Paleham church, inscribed with the following epitaph:&mdash;</p>
<p>SACRED TO THE MEMORY</p>
<p>OF</p>
<p>JOHN PONTIFEX</p>
<p>WHO WAS BORN AUGUST 16TH,</p>
<p>1727, AND DIED FEBRUARY 8, 1812,</p>
<p>IN HIS 85TH YEAR,</p>
<p>AND OF</p>
<p>RUTH PONTIFEX, HIS WIFE,</p>
<p>WHO WAS BORN OCTOBER 13, 1727, AND DIED JANUARY 10, 1811,</p>
<p>IN HER 84TH YEAR.</p>
<p>THEY WERE UNOSTENTATIOUS BUT EXEMPLARY</p>
<p>IN THE DISCHARGE OF THEIR</p>
<p>RELIGIOUS, MORAL, AND SOCIAL DUTIES.</p>
<p>THIS MONUMENT WAS PLACED</p>
<p>BY THEIR ONLY SON.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>In a year or two more came Waterloo and the European peace.&nbsp;
Then Mr George Pontifex went abroad more than once.&nbsp; I remember
seeing at Battersby in after years the diary which he kept on the first
of these occasions.&nbsp; It is a characteristic document.&nbsp; I felt
as I read it that the author before starting had made up his mind to
admire only what he thought it would be creditable in him to admire,
to look at nature and art only through the spectacles that had been
handed down to him by generation after generation of prigs and impostors.&nbsp;
The first glimpse of Mont Blanc threw Mr Pontifex into a conventional
ecstasy.&nbsp; &ldquo;My feelings I cannot express.&nbsp; I gasped,
yet hardly dared to breathe, as I viewed for the first time the monarch
of the mountains.&nbsp; I seemed to fancy the genius seated on his stupendous
throne far above his aspiring brethren and in his solitary might defying
the universe.&nbsp; I was so overcome by my feelings that I was almost
bereft of my faculties, and would not for worlds have spoken after my
first exclamation till I found some relief in a gush of tears.&nbsp;
With pain I tore myself from contemplating for the first time &lsquo;at
distance dimly seen&rsquo; (though I felt as if I had sent my soul and
eyes after it), this sublime spectacle.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a nearer
view of the Alps from above Geneva he walked nine out of the twelve
miles of the descent: &ldquo;My mind and heart were too full to sit
still, and I found some relief by exhausting my feelings through exercise.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In the course of time he reached Chamonix and went on a Sunday to the
Montanvert to see the Mer de Glace.&nbsp; There he wrote the following
verses for the visitors&rsquo; book, which he considered, so he says,
&ldquo;suitable to the day and scene&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Lord, while these wonders of thy hand I see,<br />
My soul in holy reverence bends to thee.<br />
These awful solitudes, this dread repose,<br />
Yon pyramid sublime of spotless snows,<br />
These spiry pinnacles, those smiling plains,<br />
This sea where one eternal winter reigns,<br />
These are thy works, and while on them I gaze<br />
I hear a silent tongue that speaks thy praise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some poets always begin to get groggy about the knees after running
for seven or eight lines.&nbsp; Mr Pontifex&rsquo;s last couplet gave
him a lot of trouble, and nearly every word has been erased and rewritten
once at least.&nbsp; In the visitors&rsquo; book at the Montanvert,
however, he must have been obliged to commit himself definitely to one
reading or another.&nbsp; Taking the verses all round, I should say
that Mr Pontifex was right in considering them suitable to the day;
I don&rsquo;t like being too hard even on the Mer de Glace, so will
give no opinion as to whether they are suitable to the scene also.</p>
<p>Mr Pontifex went on to the Great St Bernard and there he wrote some
more verses, this time I am afraid in Latin.&nbsp; He also took good
care to be properly impressed by the Hospice and its situation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The whole of this most extraordinary journey seemed like a dream,
its conclusion especially, in gentlemanly society, with every comfort
and accommodation amidst the rudest rocks and in the region of perpetual
snow.&nbsp; The thought that I was sleeping in a convent and occupied
the bed of no less a person than Napoleon, that I was in the highest
inhabited spot in the old world and in a place celebrated in every part
of it, kept me awake some time.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a contrast to this,
I may quote here an extract from a letter written to me last year by
his grandson Ernest, of whom the reader will hear more presently.&nbsp;
The passage runs: &ldquo;I went up to the Great St Bernard and saw the
dogs.&rdquo;&nbsp; In due course Mr Pontifex found his way into Italy,
where the pictures and other works of art&mdash;those, at least, which
were fashionable at that time&mdash;threw him into genteel paroxysms
of admiration.&nbsp; Of the Uffizi Gallery at Florence he writes: &ldquo;I
have spent three hours this morning in the gallery and I have made up
my mind that if of all the treasures I have seen in Italy I were to
choose one room it would be the Tribune of this gallery.&nbsp; It contains
the Venus de&rsquo; Medici, the Explorator, the Pancratist, the Dancing
Faun and a fine Apollo.&nbsp; These more than outweigh the Laocoon and
the Belvedere Apollo at Rome.&nbsp; It contains, besides, the St John
of Raphael and many other <i>chefs-d&rsquo;oeuvre</i> of the greatest
masters in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is interesting to compare Mr Pontifex&rsquo;s
effusions with the rhapsodies of critics in our own times.&nbsp; Not
long ago a much esteemed writer informed the world that he felt &ldquo;disposed
to cry out with delight&rdquo; before a figure by Michael Angelo.&nbsp;
I wonder whether he would feel disposed to cry out before a real Michael
Angelo, if the critics had decided that it was not genuine, or before
a reputed Michael Angelo which was really by someone else.&nbsp; But
I suppose that a prig with more money than brains was much the same
sixty or seventy years ago as he is now.</p>
<p>Look at Mendelssohn again about this same Tribune on which Mr Pontifex
felt so safe in staking his reputation as a man of taste and culture.&nbsp;
He feels no less safe and writes, &ldquo;I then went to the Tribune.&nbsp;
This room is so delightfully small you can traverse it in fifteen paces,
yet it contains a world of art.&nbsp; I again sought out my favourite
arm chair which stands under the statue of the &lsquo;Slave whetting
his knife&rsquo; (L&rsquo;Arrotino), and taking possession of it I enjoyed
myself for a couple of hours; for here at one glance I had the &lsquo;Madonna
del Cardellino,&rsquo; Pope Julius II., a female portrait by Raphael,
and above it a lovely Holy Family by Perugino; and so close to me that
I could have touched it with my hand the Venus de&rsquo; Medici; beyond,
that of Titian . . . The space between is occupied by other pictures
of Raphael&rsquo;s, a portrait by Titian, a Domenichino, etc., etc.,
all these within the circumference of a small semi-circle no larger
than one of your own rooms.&nbsp; This is a spot where a man feels his
own insignificance and may well learn to be humble.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Tribune is a slippery place for people like Mendelssohn to study humility
in.&nbsp; They generally take two steps away from it for one they take
towards it.&nbsp; I wonder how many chalks Mendelssohn gave himself
for having sat two hours on that chair.&nbsp; I wonder how often he
looked at his watch to see if his two hours were up.&nbsp; I wonder
how often he told himself that he was quite as big a gun, if the truth
were known, as any of the men whose works he saw before him, how often
he wondered whether any of the visitors were recognizing him and admiring
him for sitting such a long time in the same chair, and how often he
was vexed at seeing them pass him by and take no notice of him.&nbsp;
But perhaps if the truth were known his two hours was not quite two
hours.</p>
<p>Returning to Mr Pontifex, whether he liked what he believed to be
the masterpieces of Greek and Italian art or no he brought back some
copies by Italian artists, which I have no doubt he satisfied himself
would bear the strictest examination with the originals.&nbsp; Two of
these copies fell to Theobald&rsquo;s share on the division of his father&rsquo;s
furniture, and I have often seen them at Battersby on my visits to Theobald
and his wife.&nbsp; The one was a Madonna by Sassoferrato with a blue
hood over her head which threw it half into shadow.&nbsp; The other
was a Magdalen by Carlo Dolci with a very fine head of hair and a marble
vase in her hands.&nbsp; When I was a young man I used to think these
pictures were beautiful, but with each successive visit to Battersby
I got to dislike them more and more and to see &ldquo;George Pontifex&rdquo;
written all over both of them.&nbsp; In the end I ventured after a tentative
fashion to blow on them a little, but Theobald and his wife were up
in arms at once.&nbsp; They did not like their father and father-in-law,
but there could be no question about his power and general ability,
nor about his having been a man of consummate taste both in literature
and art&mdash;indeed the diary he kept during his foreign tour was enough
to prove this.&nbsp; With one more short extract I will leave this diary
and proceed with my story.&nbsp; During his stay in Florence Mr Pontifex
wrote: &ldquo;I have just seen the Grand Duke and his family pass by
in two carriages and six, but little more notice is taken of them than
if I, who am utterly unknown here, were to pass by.&rdquo;&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
think that he half believed in his being utterly unknown in Florence
or anywhere else!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>Fortune, we are told, is a blind and fickle foster-mother, who showers
her gifts at random upon her nurslings.&nbsp; But we do her a grave
injustice if we believe such an accusation.&nbsp; Trace a man&rsquo;s
career from his cradle to his grave and mark how Fortune has treated
him.&nbsp; You will find that when he is once dead she can for the most
part be vindicated from the charge of any but very superficial fickleness.&nbsp;
Her blindness is the merest fable; she can espy her favourites long
before they are born.&nbsp; We are as days and have had our parents
for our yesterdays, but through all the fair weather of a clear parental
sky the eye of Fortune can discern the coming storm, and she laughs
as she places her favourites it may be in a London alley or those whom
she is resolved to ruin in kings&rsquo; palaces.&nbsp; Seldom does she
relent towards those whom she has suckled unkindly and seldom does she
completely fail a favoured nursling.</p>
<p>Was George Pontifex one of Fortune&rsquo;s favoured nurslings or
not?&nbsp; On the whole I should say that he was not, for he did not
consider himself so; he was too religious to consider Fortune a deity
at all; he took whatever she gave and never thanked her, being firmly
convinced that whatever he got to his own advantage was of his own getting.&nbsp;
And so it was, after Fortune had made him able to get it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nos te, nos facimus, Fortuna, deam,&rdquo; exclaimed the poet.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is we who make thee, Fortune, a goddess&rdquo;; and so it
is, after Fortune has made us able to make her.&nbsp; The poet says
nothing as to the making of the &ldquo;nos.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps some
men are independent of antecedents and surroundings and have an initial
force within themselves which is in no way due to causation; but this
is supposed to be a difficult question and it may be as well to avoid
it.&nbsp; Let it suffice that George Pontifex did not consider himself
fortunate, and he who does not consider himself fortunate is unfortunate.</p>
<p>True, he was rich, universally respected and of an excellent natural
constitution.&nbsp; If he had eaten and drunk less he would never have
known a day&rsquo;s indisposition.&nbsp; Perhaps his main strength lay
in the fact that though his capacity was a little above the average,
it was not too much so.&nbsp; It is on this rock that so many clever
people split.&nbsp; The successful man will see just so much more than
his neighbours as they will be able to see too when it is shown them,
but not enough to puzzle them.&nbsp; It is far safer to know too little
than too much.&nbsp; People will condemn the one, though they will resent
being called upon to exert themselves to follow the other.</p>
<p>The best example of Mr Pontifex&rsquo;s good sense in matters connected
with his business which I can think of at this moment is the revolution
which he effected in the style of advertising works published by the
firm.&nbsp; When he first became a partner one of the firm&rsquo;s advertisements
ran thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Books proper to be given away at this Season.&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Pious Country Parishioner, being directions how a Christian
may manage every day in the course of his whole life with safety and
success; how to spend the Sabbath Day; what books of the Holy Scripture
ought to be read first; the whole method of education; collects for
the most important virtues that adorn the soul; a discourse on the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper; rules to set the soul right in sickness; so that in this treatise
are contained all the rules requisite for salvation.&nbsp; The 8th edition
with additions.&nbsp; Price 10d.</p>
<p>*** An allowance will be made to those who give them away.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before he had been many years a partner the advertisement stood as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Pious Country Parishioner.&nbsp; A complete
manual of Christian Devotion.&nbsp; Price 10d.</p>
<p>A reduction will be made to purchasers for gratuitous distribution.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a stride is made in the foregoing towards the modern standard,
and what intelligence is involved in the perception of the unseemliness
of the old style, when others did not perceive it!</p>
<p>Where then was the weak place in George Pontifex&rsquo;s armour?&nbsp;
I suppose in the fact that he had risen too rapidly.&nbsp; It would
almost seem as if a transmitted education of some generations is necessary
for the due enjoyment of great wealth.&nbsp; Adversity, if a man is
set down to it by degrees, is more supportable with equanimity by most
people than any great prosperity arrived at in a single lifetime.&nbsp;
Nevertheless a certain kind of good fortune generally attends self-made
men to the last.&nbsp; It is their children of the first, or first and
second, generation who are in greater danger, for the race can no more
repeat its most successful performances suddenly and without its ebbings
and flowings of success than the individual can do so, and the more
brilliant the success in any one generation, the greater as a general
rule the subsequent exhaustion until time has been allowed for recovery.&nbsp;
Hence it oftens happens that the grandson of a successful man will be
more successful than the son&mdash;the spirit that actuated the grandfather
having lain fallow in the son and being refreshed by repose so as to
be ready for fresh exertion in the grandson.&nbsp; A very successful
man, moreover, has something of the hybrid in him; he is a new animal,
arising from the coming together of many unfamiliar elements and it
is well known that the reproduction of abnormal growths, whether animal
or vegetable, is irregular and not to be depended upon, even when they
are not absolutely sterile.</p>
<p>And certainly Mr Pontifex&rsquo;s success was exceedingly rapid.&nbsp;
Only a few years after he had become a partner his uncle and aunt both
died within a few months of one another.&nbsp; It was then found that
they had made him their heir.&nbsp; He was thus not only sole partner
in the business but found himself with a fortune of some &pound;30,000
into the bargain, and this was a large sum in those days.&nbsp; Money
came pouring in upon him, and the faster it came the fonder he became
of it, though, as he frequently said, he valued it not for its own sake,
but only as a means of providing for his dear children.</p>
<p>Yet when a man is very fond of his money it is not easy for him at
all times to be very fond of his children also.&nbsp; The two are like
God and Mammon.&nbsp; Lord Macaulay has a passage in which he contrasts
the pleasures which a man may derive from books with the inconveniences
to which he may be put by his acquaintances.&nbsp; &ldquo;Plato,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;is never sullen.&nbsp; Cervantes is never petulant.&nbsp;
Demosthenes never comes unseasonably.&nbsp; Dante never stays too long.&nbsp;
No difference of political opinion can alienate Cicero.&nbsp; No heresy
can excite the horror of Bossuet.&rdquo;&nbsp; I dare say I might differ
from Lord Macaulay in my estimate of some of the writers he has named,
but there can be no disputing his main proposition, namely, that we
need have no more trouble from any of them than we have a mind to, whereas
our friends are not always so easily disposed of.&nbsp; George Pontifex
felt this as regards his children and his money.&nbsp; His money was
never naughty; his money never made noise or litter, and did not spill
things on the tablecloth at meal times, or leave the door open when
it went out.&nbsp; His dividends did not quarrel among themselves, nor
was he under any uneasiness lest his mortgages should become extravagant
on reaching manhood and run him up debts which sooner or later he should
have to pay.&nbsp; There were tendencies in John which made him very
uneasy, and Theobald, his second son, was idle and at times far from
truthful.&nbsp; His children might, perhaps, have answered, had they
known what was in their father&rsquo;s mind, that he did not knock his
money about as he not infrequently knocked his children.&nbsp; He never
dealt hastily or pettishly with his money, and that was perhaps why
he and it got on so well together.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that at the beginning of the nineteenth century
the relations between parents and children were still far from satisfactory.&nbsp;
The violent type of father, as described by Fielding, Richardson, Smollett
and Sheridan, is now hardly more likely to find a place in literature
than the original advertisement of Messrs. Fairlie &amp; Pontifex&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Pious Country Parishioner,&rdquo; but the type was much too persistent
not to have been drawn from nature closely.&nbsp; The parents in Miss
Austen&rsquo;s novels are less like savage wild beasts than those of
her predecessors, but she evidently looks upon them with suspicion,
and an uneasy feeling that <i>le p&egrave;re de famille est capable
de tout</i> makes itself sufficiently apparent throughout the greater
part of her writings.&nbsp; In the Elizabethan time the relations between
parents and children seem on the whole to have been more kindly.&nbsp;
The fathers and the sons are for the most part friends in Shakespeare,
nor does the evil appear to have reached its full abomination till a
long course of Puritanism had familiarised men&rsquo;s minds with Jewish
ideals as those which we should endeavour to reproduce in our everyday
life.&nbsp; What precedents did not Abraham, Jephthah and Jonadab the
son of Rechab offer?&nbsp; How easy was it to quote and follow them
in an age when few reasonable men or women doubted that every syllable
of the Old Testament was taken down <i>verbatim</i> from the mouth of
God.&nbsp; Moreover, Puritanism restricted natural pleasures; it substituted
the Jeremiad for the P&aelig;an, and it forgot that the poor abuses
of all times want countenance.</p>
<p>Mr Pontifex may have been a little sterner with his children than
some of his neighbours, but not much.&nbsp; He thrashed his boys two
or three times a week and some weeks a good deal oftener, but in those
days fathers were always thrashing their boys.&nbsp; It is easy to have
juster views when everyone else has them, but fortunately or unfortunately
results have nothing whatever to do with the moral guilt or blamelessness
of him who brings them about; they depend solely upon the thing done,
whatever it may happen to be.&nbsp; The moral guilt or blamelessness
in like manner has nothing to do with the result; it turns upon the
question whether a sufficient number of reasonable people placed as
the actor was placed would have done as the actor has done.&nbsp; At
that time it was universally admitted that to spare the rod was to spoil
the child, and St Paul had placed disobedience to parents in very ugly
company.&nbsp; If his children did anything which Mr Pontifex disliked
they were clearly disobedient to their father.&nbsp; In this case there
was obviously only one course for a sensible man to take.&nbsp; It consisted
in checking the first signs of self-will while his children were too
young to offer serious resistance.&nbsp; If their wills were &ldquo;well
broken&rdquo; in childhood, to use an expression then much in vogue,
they would acquire habits of obedience which they would not venture
to break through till they were over twenty-one years old.&nbsp; Then
they might please themselves; he should know how to protect himself;
till then he and his money were more at their mercy than he liked.</p>
<p>How little do we know our thoughts&mdash;our reflex actions indeed,
yes; but our reflex reflections!&nbsp; Man, forsooth, prides himself
on his consciousness!&nbsp; We boast that we differ from the winds and
waves and falling stones and plants, which grow they know not why, and
from the wandering creatures which go up and down after their prey,
as we are pleased to say without the help of reason.&nbsp; We know so
well what we are doing ourselves and why we do it, do we not?&nbsp;
I fancy that there is some truth in the view which is being put forward
nowadays, that it is our less conscious thoughts and our less conscious
actions which mainly mould our lives and the lives of those who spring
from us.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>Mr Pontifex was not the man to trouble himself much about his motives.&nbsp;
People were not so introspective then as we are now; they lived more
according to a rule of thumb.&nbsp; Dr Arnold had not yet sown that
crop of earnest thinkers which we are now harvesting, and men did not
see why they should not have their own way if no evil consequences to
themselves seemed likely to follow upon their doing so.&nbsp; Then as
now, however, they sometimes let themselves in for more evil consequences
than they had bargained for.</p>
<p>Like other rich men at the beginning of this century he ate and drank
a good deal more than was enough to keep him in health.&nbsp; Even his
excellent constitution was not proof against a prolonged course of overfeeding
and what we should now consider overdrinking.&nbsp; His liver would
not unfrequently get out of order, and he would come down to breakfast
looking yellow about the eyes.&nbsp; Then the young people knew that
they had better look out.&nbsp; It is not as a general rule the eating
of sour grapes that causes the children&rsquo;s teeth to be set on edge.&nbsp;
Well-to-do parents seldom eat many sour grapes; the danger to the children
lies in the parents eating too many sweet ones.</p>
<p>I grant that at first sight it seems very unjust, that the parents
should have the fun and the children be punished for it, but young people
should remember that for many years they were part and parcel of their
parents and therefore had a good deal of the fun in the person of their
parents.&nbsp; If they have forgotten the fun now, that is no more than
people do who have a headache after having been tipsy overnight.&nbsp;
The man with a headache does not pretend to be a different person from
the man who got drunk, and claim that it is his self of the preceding
night and not his self of this morning who should be punished; no more
should offspring complain of the headache which it has earned when in
the person of its parents, for the continuation of identity, though
not so immediately apparent, is just as real in one case as in the other.&nbsp;
What is really hard is when the parents have the fun after the children
have been born, and the children are punished for this.</p>
<p>On these, his black days, he would take very gloomy views of things
and say to himself that in spite of all his goodness to them his children
did not love him.&nbsp; But who can love any man whose liver is out
of order?&nbsp; How base, he would exclaim to himself, was such ingratitude!&nbsp;
How especially hard upon himself, who had been such a model son, and
always honoured and obeyed his parents though they had not spent one
hundredth part of the money upon him which he had lavished upon his
own children.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is always the same story,&rdquo; he would
say to himself, &ldquo;the more young people have the more they want,
and the less thanks one gets; I have made a great mistake; I have been
far too lenient with my children; never mind, I have done my duty by
them, and more; if they fail in theirs to me it is a matter between
God and them.&nbsp; I, at any rate, am guiltless.&nbsp; Why, I might
have married again and become the father of a second and perhaps more
affectionate family, etc., etc.&rdquo;&nbsp; He pitied himself for the
expensive education which he was giving his children; he did not see
that the education cost the children far more than it cost him, inasmuch
as it cost them the power of earning their living easily rather than
helped them towards it, and ensured their being at the mercy of their
father for years after they had come to an age when they should be independent.&nbsp;
A public school education cuts off a boy&rsquo;s retreat; he can no
longer become a labourer or a mechanic, and these are the only people
whose tenure of independence is not precarious&mdash;with the exception
of course of those who are born inheritors of money or who are placed
young in some safe and deep groove.&nbsp; Mr Pontifex saw nothing of
this; all he saw was that he was spending much more money upon his children
than the law would have compelled him to do, and what more could you
have?&nbsp; Might he not have apprenticed both his sons to greengrocers?&nbsp;
Might he not even yet do so to-morrow morning if he were so minded?&nbsp;
The possibility of this course being adopted was a favourite topic with
him when he was out of temper; true, he never did apprentice either
of his sons to greengrocers, but his boys comparing notes together had
sometimes come to the conclusion that they wished he would.</p>
<p>At other times when not quite well he would have them in for the
fun of shaking his will at them.&nbsp; He would in his imagination cut
them all out one after another and leave his money to found almshouses,
till at last he was obliged to put them back, so that he might have
the pleasure of cutting them out again the next time he was in a passion.</p>
<p>Of course if young people allow their conduct to be in any way influenced
by regard to the wills of living persons they are doing very wrong and
must expect to be sufferers in the end, nevertheless the powers of will-dangling
and will-shaking are so liable to abuse and are continually made so
great an engine of torture that I would pass a law, if I could, to incapacitate
any man from making a will for three months from the date of each offence
in either of the above respects and let the bench of magistrates or
judge, before whom he has been convicted, dispose of his property as
they shall think right and reasonable if he dies during the time that
his will-making power is suspended.</p>
<p>Mr Pontifex would have the boys into the dining-room.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
dear John, my dear Theobald,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;look at me.&nbsp;
I began life with nothing but the clothes with which my father and mother
sent me up to London.&nbsp; My father gave me ten shillings and my mother
five for pocket money and I thought them munificent.&nbsp; I never asked
my father for a shilling in the whole course of my life, nor took aught
from him beyond the small sum he used to allow me monthly till I was
in receipt of a salary.&nbsp; I made my own way and I shall expect my
sons to do the same.&nbsp; Pray don&rsquo;t take it into your heads
that I am going to wear my life out making money that my sons may spend
it for me.&nbsp; If you want money you must make it for yourselves as
I did, for I give you my word I will not leave a penny to either of
you unless you show that you deserve it.&nbsp; Young people seem nowadays
to expect all kinds of luxuries and indulgences which were never heard
of when I was a boy.&nbsp; Why, my father was a common carpenter, and
here you are both of you at public schools, costing me ever so many
hundreds a year, while I at your age was plodding away behind a desk
in my Uncle Fairlie&rsquo;s counting house.&nbsp; What should I not
have done if I had had one half of your advantages?&nbsp; You should
become dukes or found new empires in undiscovered countries, and even
then I doubt whether you would have done proportionately so much as
I have done.&nbsp; No, no, I shall see you through school and college
and then, if you please, you will make your own way in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this manner he would work himself up into such a state of virtuous
indignation that he would sometimes thrash the boys then and there upon
some pretext invented at the moment.</p>
<p>And yet, as children went, the young Pontifexes were fortunate; there
would be ten families of young people worse off for one better; they
ate and drank good wholesome food, slept in comfortable beds, had the
best doctors to attend them when they were ill and the best education
that could be had for money.&nbsp; The want of fresh air does not seem
much to affect the happiness of children in a London alley: the greater
part of them sing and play as though they were on a moor in Scotland.&nbsp;
So the absence of a genial mental atmosphere is not commonly recognised
by children who have never known it.&nbsp; Young people have a marvellous
faculty of either dying or adapting themselves to circumstances.&nbsp;
Even if they are unhappy&mdash;very unhappy&mdash;it is astonishing
how easily they can be prevented from finding it out, or at any rate
from attributing it to any other cause than their own sinfulness.</p>
<p>To parents who wish to lead a quiet life I would say: Tell your children
that they are very naughty&mdash;much naughtier than most children.&nbsp;
Point to the young people of some acquaintances as models of perfection
and impress your own children with a deep sense of their own inferiority.&nbsp;
You carry so many more guns than they do that they cannot fight you.&nbsp;
This is called moral influence, and it will enable you to bounce them
as much as you please.&nbsp; They think you know and they will not have
yet caught you lying often enough to suspect that you are not the unworldly
and scrupulously truthful person which you represent yourself to be;
nor yet will they know how great a coward you are, nor how soon you
will run away, if they fight you with persistency and judgement.&nbsp;
You keep the dice and throw them both for your children and yourself.&nbsp;
Load them then, for you can easily manage to stop your children from
examining them.&nbsp; Tell them how singularly indulgent you are; insist
on the incalculable benefit you conferred upon them, firstly in bringing
them into the world at all, but more particularly in bringing them into
it as your own children rather than anyone else&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Say that
you have their highest interests at stake whenever you are out of temper
and wish to make yourself unpleasant by way of balm to your soul.&nbsp;
Harp much upon these highest interests.&nbsp; Feed them spiritually
upon such brimstone and treacle as the late Bishop of Winchester&rsquo;s
Sunday stories.&nbsp; You hold all the trump cards, or if you do not
you can filch them; if you play them with anything like judgement you
will find yourselves heads of happy, united, God-fearing families, even
as did my old friend Mr Pontifex.&nbsp; True, your children will probably
find out all about it some day, but not until too late to be of much
service to them or inconvenience to yourself.</p>
<p>Some satirists have complained of life inasmuch as all the pleasures
belong to the fore part of it and we must see them dwindle till we are
left, it may be, with the miseries of a decrepit old age.</p>
<p>To me it seems that youth is like spring, an overpraised season&mdash;delightful
if it happen to be a favoured one, but in practice very rarely favoured
and more remarkable, as a general rule, for biting east winds than genial
breezes.&nbsp; Autumn is the mellower season, and what we lose in flowers
we more than gain in fruits.&nbsp; Fontenelle at the age of ninety,
being asked what was the happiest time of his life, said he did not
know that he had ever been much happier than he then was, but that perhaps
his best years had been those when he was between fifty-five and seventy-five,
and Dr Johnson placed the pleasures of old age far higher than those
of youth.&nbsp; True, in old age we live under the shadow of Death,
which, like a sword of Damocles, may descend at any moment, but we have
so long found life to be an affair of being rather frightened than hurt
that we have become like the people who live under Vesuvius, and chance
it without much misgiving.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>A few words may suffice for the greater number of the young people
to whom I have been alluding in the foregoing chapter.&nbsp; Eliza and
Maria, the two elder girls, were neither exactly pretty nor exactly
plain, and were in all respects model young ladies, but Alethea was
exceedingly pretty and of a lively, affectionate disposition, which
was in sharp contrast with those of her brothers and sisters.&nbsp;
There was a trace of her grandfather, not only in her face, but in her
love of fun, of which her father had none, though not without a certain
boisterous and rather coarse quasi-humour which passed for wit with
many.</p>
<p>John grew up to be a good-looking, gentlemanly fellow, with features
a trifle too regular and finely chiselled.&nbsp; He dressed himself
so nicely, had such good address, and stuck so steadily to his books
that he became a favourite with his masters; he had, however, an instinct
for diplomacy, and was less popular with the boys.&nbsp; His father,
in spite of the lectures he would at times read him, was in a way proud
of him as he grew older; he saw in him, moreover, one who would probably
develop into a good man of business, and in whose hands the prospects
of his house would not be likely to decline.&nbsp; John knew how to
humour his father, and was at a comparatively early age admitted to
as much of his confidence as it was in his nature to bestow on anyone.</p>
<p>His brother Theobald was no match for him, knew it, and accepted
his fate.&nbsp; He was not so good-looking as his brother, nor was his
address so good; as a child he had been violently passionate; now, however,
he was reserved and shy, and, I should say, indolent in mind and body.&nbsp;
He was less tidy than John, less well able to assert himself, and less
skilful in humouring the caprices of his father.&nbsp; I do not think
he could have loved anyone heartily, but there was no one in his family
circle who did not repress, rather than invite his affection, with the
exception of his sister Alethea, and she was too quick and lively for
his somewhat morose temper.&nbsp; He was always the scapegoat, and I
have sometimes thought he had two fathers to contend against&mdash;his
father and his brother John; a third and fourth also might almost be
added in his sisters Eliza and Maria.&nbsp; Perhaps if he had felt his
bondage very acutely he would not have put up with it, but he was constitutionally
timid, and the strong hand of his father knitted him into the closest
outward harmony with his brother and sisters.</p>
<p>The boys were of use to their father in one respect.&nbsp; I mean
that he played them off against each other.&nbsp; He kept them but poorly
supplied with pocket money, and to Theobald would urge that the claims
of his elder brother were naturally paramount, while he insisted to
John upon the fact that he had a numerous family, and would affirm solemnly
that his expenses were so heavy that at his death there would be very
little to divide.&nbsp; He did not care whether they compared notes
or no, provided they did not do so in his presence.&nbsp; Theobald did
not complain even behind his father&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; I knew him as
intimately as anyone was likely to know him as a child, at school, and
again at Cambridge, but he very rarely mentioned his father&rsquo;s
name even while his father was alive, and never once in my hearing afterwards.&nbsp;
At school he was not actively disliked as his brother was, but he was
too dull and deficient in animal spirits to be popular.</p>
<p>Before he was well out of his frocks it was settled that he was to
be a clergyman.&nbsp; It was seemly that Mr Pontifex, the well-known
publisher of religious books, should devote at least one of his sons
to the Church; this might tend to bring business, or at any rate to
keep it in the firm; besides, Mr Pontifex had more or less interest
with bishops and Church dignitaries and might hope that some preferment
would be offered to his son through his influence.&nbsp; The boy&rsquo;s
future destiny was kept well before his eyes from his earliest childhood
and was treated as a matter which he had already virtually settled by
his acquiescence.&nbsp; Nevertheless a certain show of freedom was allowed
him.&nbsp; Mr Pontifex would say it was only right to give a boy his
option, and was much too equitable to grudge his son whatever benefit
he could derive from this.&nbsp; He had the greatest horror, he would
exclaim, of driving any young man into a profession which he did not
like.&nbsp; Far be it from him to put pressure upon a son of his as
regards any profession and much less when so sacred a calling as the
ministry was concerned.&nbsp; He would talk in this way when there were
visitors in the house and when his son was in the room.&nbsp; He spoke
so wisely and so well that his listening guests considered him a paragon
of right-mindedness.&nbsp; He spoke, too, with such emphasis and his
rosy gills and bald head looked so benevolent that it was difficult
not to be carried away by his discourse.&nbsp; I believe two or three
heads of families in the neighbourhood gave their sons absolute liberty
of choice in the matter of their professions&mdash;and am not sure that
they had not afterwards considerable cause to regret having done so.&nbsp;
The visitors, seeing Theobald look shy and wholly unmoved by the exhibition
of so much consideration for his wishes, would remark to themselves
that the boy seemed hardly likely to be equal to his father and would
set him down as an unenthusiastic youth, who ought to have more life
in him and be more sensible of his advantages than he appeared to be.</p>
<p>No one believed in the righteousness of the whole transaction more
firmly than the boy himself; a sense of being ill at ease kept him silent,
but it was too profound and too much without break for him to become
fully alive to it, and come to an understanding with himself.&nbsp;
He feared the dark scowl which would come over his father&rsquo;s face
upon the slightest opposition.&nbsp; His father&rsquo;s violent threats,
or coarse sneers, would not have been taken <i>au s&eacute;rieux</i>
by a stronger boy, but Theobald was not a strong boy, and rightly or
wrongly, gave his father credit for being quite ready to carry his threats
into execution.&nbsp; Opposition had never got him anything he wanted
yet, nor indeed had yielding, for the matter of that, unless he happened
to want exactly what his father wanted for him.&nbsp; If he had ever
entertained thoughts of resistance, he had none now, and the power to
oppose was so completely lost for want of exercise that hardly did the
wish remain; there was nothing left save dull acquiescence as of an
ass crouched between two burdens.&nbsp; He may have had an ill-defined
sense of ideals that were not his actuals; he might occasionally dream
of himself as a soldier or a sailor far away in foreign lands, or even
as a farmer&rsquo;s boy upon the wolds, but there was not enough in
him for there to be any chance of his turning his dreams into realities,
and he drifted on with his stream, which was a slow, and, I am afraid,
a muddy one.</p>
<p>I think the Church Catechism has a good deal to do with the unhappy
relations which commonly even now exist between parents and children.&nbsp;
That work was written too exclusively from the parental point of view;
the person who composed it did not get a few children to come in and
help him; he was clearly not young himself, nor should I say it was
the work of one who liked children&mdash;in spite of the words &ldquo;my
good child&rdquo; which, if I remember rightly, are once put into the
mouth of the catechist and, after all, carry a harsh sound with them.&nbsp;
The general impression it leaves upon the mind of the young is that
their wickedness at birth was but very imperfectly wiped out at baptism,
and that the mere fact of being young at all has something with it that
savours more or less distinctly of the nature of sin.</p>
<p>If a new edition of the work is ever required I should like to introduce
a few words insisting on the duty of seeking all reasonable pleasure
and avoiding all pain that can be honourably avoided.&nbsp; I should
like to see children taught that they should not say they like things
which they do not like, merely because certain other people say they
like them, and how foolish it is to say they believe this or that when
they understand nothing about it.&nbsp; If it be urged that these additions
would make the Catechism too long I would curtail the remarks upon our
duty towards our neighbour and upon the sacraments.&nbsp; In the place
of the paragraph beginning &ldquo;I desire my Lord God our Heavenly
Father&rdquo; I would&mdash;but perhaps I had better return to Theobald,
and leave the recasting of the Catechism to abler hands.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>Mr Pontifex had set his heart on his son&rsquo;s becoming a fellow
of a college before he became a clergyman.&nbsp; This would provide
for him at once and would ensure his getting a living if none of his
father&rsquo;s ecclesiastical friends gave him one.&nbsp; The boy had
done just well enough at school to render this possible, so he was sent
to one of the smaller colleges at Cambridge and was at once set to read
with the best private tutors that could be found.&nbsp; A system of
examination had been adopted a year or so before Theobald took his degree
which had improved his chances of a fellowship, for whatever ability
he had was classical rather than mathematical, and this system gave
more encouragement to classical studies than had been given hitherto.</p>
<p>Theobald had the sense to see that he had a chance of independence
if he worked hard, and he liked the notion of becoming a fellow.&nbsp;
He therefore applied himself, and in the end took a degree which made
his getting a fellowship in all probability a mere question of time.&nbsp;
For a while Mr Pontifex senior was really pleased, and told his son
he would present him with the works of any standard writer whom he might
select.&nbsp; The young man chose the works of Bacon, and Bacon accordingly
made his appearance in ten nicely bound volumes.&nbsp; A little inspection,
however, showed that the copy was a second hand one.</p>
<p>Now that he had taken his degree the next thing to look forward to
was ordination&mdash;about which Theobald had thought little hitherto
beyond acquiescing in it as something that would come as a matter of
course some day.&nbsp; Now, however, it had actually come and was asserting
itself as a thing which should be only a few months off, and this rather
frightened him inasmuch as there would be no way out of it when he was
once in it.&nbsp; He did not like the near view of ordination as well
as the distant one, and even made some feeble efforts to escape, as
may be perceived by the following correspondence which his son Ernest
found among his father&rsquo;s papers written on gilt-edged paper, in
faded ink and tied neatly round with a piece of tape, but without any
note or comment.&nbsp; I have altered nothing.&nbsp; The letters are
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My dear Father,&mdash;I do not like opening up
a question which has been considered settled, but as the time approaches
I begin to be very doubtful how far I am fitted to be a clergyman.&nbsp;
Not, I am thankful to say, that I have the faintest doubts about the
Church of England, and I could subscribe cordially to every one of the
thirty-nine articles which do indeed appear to me to be the <i>ne plus
ultra</i> of human wisdom, and Paley, too, leaves no loop-hole for an
opponent; but I am sure I should be running counter to your wishes if
I were to conceal from you that I do not feel the inward call to be
a minister of the gospel that I shall have to say I have felt when the
Bishop ordains me.&nbsp; I try to get this feeling, I pray for it earnestly,
and sometimes half think that I have got it, but in a little time it
wears off, and though I have no absolute repugnance to being a clergyman
and trust that if I am one I shall endeavour to live to the Glory of
God and to advance His interests upon earth, yet I feel that something
more than this is wanted before I am fully justified in going into the
Church.&nbsp; I am aware that I have been a great expense to you in
spite of my scholarships, but you have ever taught me that I should
obey my conscience, and my conscience tells me I should do wrong if
I became a clergyman.&nbsp; God may yet give me the spirit for which
I assure you I have been and am continually praying, but He may not,
and in that case would it not be better for me to try and look out for
something else?&nbsp; I know that neither you nor John wish me to go
into your business, nor do I understand anything about money matters,
but is there nothing else that I can do?&nbsp; I do not like to ask
you to maintain me while I go in for medicine or the bar; but when I
get my fellowship, which should not be long first, I will endeavour
to cost you nothing further, and I might make a little money by writing
or taking pupils.&nbsp; I trust you will not think this letter improper;
nothing is further from my wish than to cause you any uneasiness.&nbsp;
I hope you will make allowance for my present feelings which, indeed,
spring from nothing but from that respect for my conscience which no
one has so often instilled into me as yourself.&nbsp; Pray let me have
a few lines shortly.&nbsp; I hope your cold is better.&nbsp; With love
to Eliza and Maria, I am, your affectionate son,</p>
<p>&ldquo;THEOBALD PONTIFEX.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Theobald,&mdash;I can enter into your feelings and have
no wish to quarrel with your expression of them.&nbsp; It is quite right
and natural that you should feel as you do except as regards one passage,
the impropriety of which you will yourself doubtless feel upon reflection,
and to which I will not further allude than to say that it has wounded
me.&nbsp; You should not have said &lsquo;in spite of my scholarships.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It was only proper that if you could do anything to assist me in bearing
the heavy burden of your education, the money should be, as it was,
made over to myself.&nbsp; Every line in your letter convinces me that
you are under the influence of a morbid sensitiveness which is one of
the devil&rsquo;s favourite devices for luring people to their destruction.&nbsp;
I have, as you say, been at great expense with your education.&nbsp;
Nothing has been spared by me to give you the advantages, which, as
an English gentleman, I was anxious to afford my son, but I am not prepared
to see that expense thrown away and to have to begin again from the
beginning, merely because you have taken some foolish scruples into
your head, which you should resist as no less unjust to yourself than
to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give way to that restless desire for change which
is the bane of so many persons of both sexes at the present day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you needn&rsquo;t be ordained: nobody will compel
you; you are perfectly free; you are twenty-three years of age, and
should know your own mind; but why not have known it sooner, instead
of never so much as breathing a hint of opposition until I have had
all the expense of sending you to the University, which I should never
have done unless I had believed you to have made up your mind about
taking orders?&nbsp; I have letters from you in which you express the
most perfect willingness to be ordained, and your brother and sisters
will bear me out in saying that no pressure of any sort has been put
upon you.&nbsp; You mistake your own mind, and are suffering from a
nervous timidity which may be very natural but may not the less be pregnant
with serious consequences to yourself.&nbsp; I am not at all well, and
the anxiety occasioned by your letter is naturally preying upon me.&nbsp;
May God guide you to a better judgement.&mdash;Your affectionate father,
G. PONTIFEX.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the receipt of this letter Theobald plucked up his spirits.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My father,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;tells me I need
not be ordained if I do not like.&nbsp; I do not like, and therefore
I will not be ordained.&nbsp; But what was the meaning of the words
&lsquo;pregnant with serious consequences to yourself&rsquo;?&nbsp;
Did there lurk a threat under these words&mdash;though it was impossible
to lay hold of it or of them?&nbsp; Were they not intended to produce
all the effect of a threat without being actually threatening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Theobald knew his father well enough to be little likely to misapprehend
his meaning, but having ventured so far on the path of opposition, and
being really anxious to get out of being ordained if he could, he determined
to venture farther.&nbsp; He accordingly wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My dear father,&mdash;You tell me&mdash;and I
heartily thank you&mdash;that no one will compel me to be ordained.&nbsp;
I knew you would not press ordination upon me if my conscience was seriously
opposed to it; I have therefore resolved on giving up the idea, and
believe that if you will continue to allow me what you do at present,
until I get my fellowship, which should not be long, I will then cease
putting you to further expense.&nbsp; I will make up my mind as soon
as possible what profession I will adopt, and will let you know at once.&mdash;Your
affectionate son, THEOBALD PONTIFEX.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The remaining letter, written by return of post, must now be given.&nbsp;
It has the merit of brevity.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dear Theobald,&mdash;I have received yours.&nbsp;
I am at a loss to conceive its motive, but am very clear as to its effect.&nbsp;
You shall not receive a single sixpence from me till you come to your
senses.&nbsp; Should you persist in your folly and wickedness, I am
happy to remember that I have yet other children whose conduct I can
depend upon to be a source of credit and happiness to me.&mdash;Your
affectionate but troubled father, G. PONTIFEX.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not know the immediate sequel to the foregoing correspondence,
but it all came perfectly right in the end.&nbsp; Either Theobald&rsquo;s
heart failed him, or he interpreted the outward shove which his father
gave him, as the inward call for which I have no doubt he prayed with
great earnestness&mdash;for he was a firm believer in the efficacy of
prayer.&nbsp; And so am I under certain circumstances.&nbsp; Tennyson
has said that more things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams
of, but he has wisely refrained from saying whether they are good things
or bad things.&nbsp; It might perhaps be as well if the world were to
dream of, or even become wide awake to, some of the things that are
being wrought by prayer.&nbsp; But the question is avowedly difficult.&nbsp;
In the end Theobald got his fellowship by a stroke of luck very soon
after taking his degree, and was ordained in the autumn of the same
year, 1825.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>Mr Allaby was rector of Crampsford, a village a few miles from Cambridge.&nbsp;
He, too, had taken a good degree, had got a fellowship, and in the course
of time had accepted a college living of about &pound;400 a year and
a house.&nbsp; His private income did not exceed &pound;200 a year.&nbsp;
On resigning his fellowship he married a woman a good deal younger than
himself who bore him eleven children, nine of whom&mdash;two sons and
seven daughters&mdash;were living.&nbsp; The two eldest daughters had
married fairly well, but at the time of which I am now writing there
were still five unmarried, of ages varying between thirty and twenty-two&mdash;and
the sons were neither of them yet off their father&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp;
It was plain that if anything were to happen to Mr Allaby the family
would be left poorly off, and this made both Mr and Mrs Allaby as unhappy
as it ought to have made them.</p>
<p>Reader, did you ever have an income at best none too large, which
died with you all except &pound;200 a year?&nbsp; Did you ever at the
same time have two sons who must be started in life somehow, and five
daughters still unmarried for whom you would only be too thankful to
find husbands&mdash;if you knew how to find them?&nbsp; If morality
is that which, on the whole, brings a man peace in his declining years&mdash;if,
that is to say, it is not an utter swindle, can you under these circumstances
flatter yourself that you have led a moral life?</p>
<p>And this, even though your wife has been so good a woman that you
have not grown tired of her, and has not fallen into such ill-health
as lowers your own health in sympathy; and though your family has grown
up vigorous, amiable, and blessed with common sense.&nbsp; I know many
old men and women who are reputed moral, but who are living with partners
whom they have long ceased to love, or who have ugly disagreeable maiden
daughters for whom they have never been able to find husbands&mdash;daughters
whom they loathe and by whom they are loathed in secret, or sons whose
folly or extravagance is a perpetual wear and worry to them.&nbsp; Is
it moral for a man to have brought such things upon himself?&nbsp; Someone
should do for morals what that old Pecksniff Bacon has obtained the
credit of having done for science.</p>
<p>But to return to Mr and Mrs Allaby.&nbsp; Mrs Allaby talked about
having married two of her daughters as though it had been the easiest
thing in the world.&nbsp; She talked in this way because she heard other
mothers do so, but in her heart of hearts she did not know how she had
done it, nor indeed, if it had been her doing at all.&nbsp; First there
had been a young man in connection with whom she had tried to practise
certain manoeuvres which she had rehearsed in imagination over and over
again, but which she found impossible to apply in practice.&nbsp; Then
there had been weeks of a <i>wurra wurra</i> of hopes and fears and
little stratagems which as often as not proved injudicious, and then
somehow or other in the end, there lay the young man bound and with
an arrow through his heart at her daughter&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; It seemed
to her to be all a fluke which she could have little or no hope of repeating.&nbsp;
She had indeed repeated it once, and might perhaps with good luck repeat
it yet once again&mdash;but five times over!&nbsp; It was awful: why
she would rather have three confinements than go through the wear and
tear of marrying a single daughter.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it had got to be done, and poor Mrs Allaby never looked
at a young man without an eye to his being a future son-in-law.&nbsp;
Papas and mammas sometimes ask young men whether their intentions are
honourable towards their daughters.&nbsp; I think young men might occasionally
ask papas and mammas whether their intentions are honourable before
they accept invitations to houses where there are still unmarried daughters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford a curate, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr Allaby
to his wife when the pair were discussing what was next to be done.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It will be better to get some young man to come and help me for
a time upon a Sunday.&nbsp; A guinea a Sunday will do this, and we can
chop and change till we get someone who suits.&rdquo;&nbsp; So it was
settled that Mr Allaby&rsquo;s health was not so strong as it had been,
and that he stood in need of help in the performance of his Sunday duty.</p>
<p>Mrs Allaby had a great friend&mdash;a certain Mrs Cowey, wife of
the celebrated Professor Cowey.&nbsp; She was what was called a truly
spiritually minded woman, a trifle portly, with an incipient beard,
and an extensive connection among undergraduates, more especially among
those who were inclined to take part in the great evangelical movement
which was then at its height.&nbsp; She gave evening parties once a
fortnight at which prayer was part of the entertainment.&nbsp; She was
not only spiritually minded, but, as enthusiastic Mrs Allaby used to
exclaim, she was a thorough woman of the world at the same time and
had such a fund of strong masculine good sense.&nbsp; She too had daughters,
but, as she used to say to Mrs Allaby, she had been less fortunate than
Mrs Allaby herself, for one by one they had married and left her so
that her old age would have been desolate indeed if her Professor had
not been spared to her.</p>
<p>Mrs Cowey, of course, knew the run of all the bachelor clergy in
the University, and was the very person to assist Mrs Allaby in finding
an eligible assistant for her husband, so this last named lady drove
over one morning in the November of 1825, by arrangement, to take an
early dinner with Mrs Cowey and spend the afternoon.&nbsp; After dinner
the two ladies retired together, and the business of the day began.&nbsp;
How they fenced, how they saw through one another, with what loyalty
they pretended not to see through one another, with what gentle dalliance
they prolonged the conversation discussing the spiritual fitness of
this or that deacon, and the other pros and cons connected with him
after his spiritual fitness had been disposed of, all this must be left
to the imagination of the reader.&nbsp; Mrs Cowey had been so accustomed
to scheming on her own account that she would scheme for anyone rather
than not scheme at all.&nbsp; Many mothers turned to her in their hour
of need and, provided they were spiritually minded, Mrs Cowey never
failed to do her best for them; if the marriage of a young Bachelor
of Arts was not made in Heaven, it was probably made, or at any rate
attempted, in Mrs Cowey&rsquo;s drawing-room.&nbsp; On the present occasion
all the deacons of the University in whom there lurked any spark of
promise were exhaustively discussed, and the upshot was that our friend
Theobald was declared by Mrs Cowey to be about the best thing she could
do that afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that he&rsquo;s a particularly fascinating
young man, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs Cowey, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s only
a second son, but then he&rsquo;s got his fellowship, and even the second
son of such a man as Mr Pontifex the publisher should have something
very comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why yes, my dear,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs Allaby complacently,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s what one rather feels.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>The interview, like all other good things had to come to an end;
the days were short, and Mrs Allaby had a six miles&rsquo; drive to
Crampsford.&nbsp; When she was muffled up and had taken her seat, Mr
Allaby&rsquo;s <i>factotum</i>, James, could perceive no change in her
appearance, and little knew what a series of delightful visions he was
driving home along with his mistress.</p>
<p>Professor Cowey had published works through Theobald&rsquo;s father,
and Theobald had on this account been taken in tow by Mrs Cowey from
the beginning of his University career.&nbsp; She had had her eye upon
him for some time past, and almost as much felt it her duty to get him
off her list of young men for whom wives had to be provided, as poor
Mrs Allaby did to try and get a husband for one of her daughters.&nbsp;
She now wrote and asked him to come and see her, in terms that awakened
his curiosity.&nbsp; When he came she broached the subject of Mr Allaby&rsquo;s
failing health, and after the smoothing away of such difficulties as
were only Mrs Cowey&rsquo;s due, considering the interest she had taken,
it was allowed to come to pass that Theobald should go to Crampsford
for six successive Sundays and take the half of Mr Allaby&rsquo;s duty
at half a guinea a Sunday, for Mrs Cowey cut down the usual stipend
mercilessly, and Theobald was not strong enough to resist.</p>
<p>Ignorant of the plots which were being prepared for his peace of
mind and with no idea beyond that of earning his three guineas, and
perhaps of astonishing the inhabitants of Crampsford by his academic
learning, Theobald walked over to the Rectory one Sunday morning early
in December&mdash;a few weeks only after he had been ordained.&nbsp;
He had taken a great deal of pains with his sermon, which was on the
subject of geology&mdash;then coming to the fore as a theological bugbear.&nbsp;
He showed that so far as geology was worth anything at all&mdash;and
he was too liberal entirely to pooh-pooh it&mdash;it confirmed the absolutely
historical character of the Mosaic account of the Creation as given
in Genesis.&nbsp; Any phenomena which at first sight appeared to make
against this view were only partial phenomena and broke down upon investigation.&nbsp;
Nothing could be in more excellent taste, and when Theobald adjourned
to the rectory, where he was to dine between the services, Mr Allaby
complimented him warmly upon his d&eacute;but, while the ladies of the
family could hardly find words with which to express their admiration.</p>
<p>Theobald knew nothing about women.&nbsp; The only women he had been
thrown in contact with were his sisters, two of whom were always correcting
him, and a few school friends whom these had got their father to ask
to Elmhurst.&nbsp; These young ladies had either been so shy that they
and Theobald had never amalgamated, or they had been supposed to be
clever and had said smart things to him.&nbsp; He did not say smart
things himself and did not want other people to say them.&nbsp; Besides,
they talked about music&mdash;and he hated music&mdash;or pictures&mdash;and
he hated pictures&mdash;or books&mdash;and except the classics he hated
books.&nbsp; And then sometimes he was wanted to dance with them, and
he did not know how to dance, and did not want to know.</p>
<p>At Mrs Cowey&rsquo;s parties again he had seen some young ladies
and had been introduced to them.&nbsp; He had tried to make himself
agreeable, but was always left with the impression that he had not been
successful.&nbsp; The young ladies of Mrs Cowey&rsquo;s set were by
no means the most attractive that might have been found in the University,
and Theobald may be excused for not losing his heart to the greater
number of them, while if for a minute or two he was thrown in with one
of the prettier and more agreeable girls he was almost immediately cut
out by someone less bashful than himself, and sneaked off, feeling as
far as the fair sex was concerned, like the impotent man at the pool
of Bethesda.</p>
<p>What a really nice girl might have done with him I cannot tell, but
fate had thrown none such in his way except his youngest sister Alethea,
whom he might perhaps have liked if she had not been his sister.&nbsp;
The result of his experience was that women had never done him any good
and he was not accustomed to associate them with any pleasure; if there
was a part of Hamlet in connection with them it had been so completely
cut out in the edition of the play in which he was required to act that
he had come to disbelieve in its existence.&nbsp; As for kissing, he
had never kissed a woman in his life except his sister&mdash;and my
own sisters when we were all small children together.&nbsp; Over and
above these kisses, he had until quite lately been required to imprint
a solemn flabby kiss night and morning upon his father&rsquo;s cheek,
and this, to the best of my belief, was the extent of Theobald&rsquo;s
knowledge in the matter of kissing, at the time of which I am now writing.&nbsp;
The result of the foregoing was that he had come to dislike women, as
mysterious beings whose ways were not as his ways, nor their thoughts
as his thoughts.</p>
<p>With these antecedents Theobald naturally felt rather bashful on
finding himself the admired of five strange young ladies.&nbsp; I remember
when I was a boy myself I was once asked to take tea at a girls&rsquo;
school where one of my sisters was boarding.&nbsp; I was then about
twelve years old.&nbsp; Everything went off well during tea-time, for
the Lady Principal of the establishment was present.&nbsp; But there
came a time when she went away and I was left alone with the girls.&nbsp;
The moment the mistress&rsquo;s back was turned the head girl, who was
about my own age, came up, pointed her finger at me, made a face and
said solemnly, &ldquo;A na-a-sty bo-o-y!&rdquo;&nbsp; All the girls
followed her in rotation making the same gesture and the same reproach
upon my being a boy.&nbsp; It gave me a great scare.&nbsp; I believe
I cried, and I know it was a long time before I could again face a girl
without a strong desire to run away.</p>
<p>Theobald felt at first much as I had myself done at the girls&rsquo;
school, but the Miss Allabys did not tell him he was a nasty bo-o-oy.&nbsp;
Their papa and mamma were so cordial and they themselves lifted him
so deftly over conversational stiles that before dinner was over Theobald
thought the family to be a really very charming one, and felt as though
he were being appreciated in a way to which he had not hitherto been
accustomed.</p>
<p>With dinner his shyness wore off.&nbsp; He was by no means plain,
his academic prestige was very fair.&nbsp; There was nothing about him
to lay hold of as unconventional or ridiculous; the impression he created
upon the young ladies was quite as favourable as that which they had
created upon himself; for they knew not much more about men than he
about women.</p>
<p>As soon as he was gone, the harmony of the establishment was broken
by a storm which arose upon the question which of them it should be
who should become Mrs Pontifex.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dears,&rdquo; said their
father, when he saw that they did not seem likely to settle the matter
among themselves, &ldquo;Wait till to-morrow, and then play at cards
for him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having said which he retired to his study, where
he took a nightly glass of whisky and a pipe of tobacco.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>The next morning saw Theobald in his rooms coaching a pupil, and
the Miss Allabys in the eldest Miss Allaby&rsquo;s bedroom playing at
cards with Theobald for the stakes.</p>
<p>The winner was Christina, the second unmarried daughter, then just
twenty-seven years old and therefore four years older than Theobald.&nbsp;
The younger sisters complained that it was throwing a husband away to
let Christina try and catch him, for she was so much older that she
had no chance; but Christina showed fight in a way not usual with her,
for she was by nature yielding and good tempered.&nbsp; Her mother thought
it better to back her up, so the two dangerous ones were packed off
then and there on visits to friends some way off, and those alone allowed
to remain at home whose loyalty could be depended upon.&nbsp; The brothers
did not even suspect what was going on and believed their father&rsquo;s
getting assistance was because he really wanted it.</p>
<p>The sisters who remained at home kept their words and gave Christina
all the help they could, for over and above their sense of fair play
they reflected that the sooner Theobald was landed, the sooner another
deacon might be sent for who might be won by themselves.&nbsp; So quickly
was all managed that the two unreliable sisters were actually out of
the house before Theobald&rsquo;s next visit&mdash;which was on the
Sunday following his first.</p>
<p>This time Theobald felt quite at home in the house of his new friends&mdash;for
so Mrs Allaby insisted that he should call them.&nbsp; She took, she
said, such a motherly interest in young men, especially in clergymen.&nbsp;
Theobald believed every word she said, as he had believed his father
and all his elders from his youth up.&nbsp; Christina sat next him at
dinner and played her cards no less judiciously than she had played
them in her sister&rsquo;s bedroom.&nbsp; She smiled (and her smile
was one of her strong points) whenever he spoke to her; she went through
all her little artlessnesses and set forth all her little wares in what
she believed to be their most taking aspect.&nbsp; Who can blame her?&nbsp;
Theobald was not the ideal she had dreamed of when reading Byron upstairs
with her sisters, but he was an actual within the bounds of possibility,
and after all not a bad actual as actuals went.&nbsp; What else could
she do?&nbsp; Run away?&nbsp; She dared not.&nbsp; Marry beneath her
and be considered a disgrace to her family?&nbsp; She dared not.&nbsp;
Remain at home and become an old maid and be laughed at?&nbsp; Not if
she could help it.&nbsp; She did the only thing that could reasonably
be expected.&nbsp; She was drowning; Theobald might be only a straw,
but she could catch at him and catch at him she accordingly did.</p>
<p>If the course of true love never runs smooth, the course of true
match-making sometimes does so.&nbsp; The only ground for complaint
in the present case was that it was rather slow.&nbsp; Theobald fell
into the part assigned to him more easily than Mrs Cowey and Mrs Allaby
had dared to hope.&nbsp; He was softened by Christina&rsquo;s winning
manners: he admired the high moral tone of everything she said; her
sweetness towards her sisters and her father and mother, her readiness
to undertake any small burden which no one else seemed willing to undertake,
her sprightly manners, all were fascinating to one who, though unused
to woman&rsquo;s society, was still a human being.&nbsp; He was flattered
by her unobtrusive but obviously sincere admiration for himself; she
seemed to see him in a more favourable light, and to understand him
better than anyone outside of this charming family had ever done.&nbsp;
Instead of snubbing him as his father, brother and sisters did, she
drew him out, listened attentively to all he chose to say, and evidently
wanted him to say still more.&nbsp; He told a college friend that he
knew he was in love now; he really was, for he liked Miss Allaby&rsquo;s
society much better than that of his sisters.</p>
<p>Over and above the recommendations already enumerated, she had another
in the possession of what was supposed to be a very beautiful contralto
voice.&nbsp; Her voice was certainly contralto, for she could not reach
higher than D in the treble; its only defect was that it did not go
correspondingly low in the bass: in those days, however, a contralto
voice was understood to include even a soprano if the soprano could
not reach soprano notes, and it was not necessary that it should have
the quality which we now assign to contralto.&nbsp; What her voice wanted
in range and power was made up in the feeling with which she sang.&nbsp;
She had transposed &ldquo;Angels ever bright and fair&rdquo; into a
lower key, so as to make it suit her voice, thus proving, as her mamma
said, that she had a thorough knowledge of the laws of harmony; not
only did she do this, but at every pause added an embellishment of arpeggios
from one end to the other of the keyboard, on a principle which her
governess had taught her; she thus added life and interest to an air
which everyone&mdash;so she said&mdash;must feel to be rather heavy
in the form in which Handel left it.&nbsp; As for her governess, she
indeed had been a rarely accomplished musician: she was a pupil of the
famous Dr Clarke of Cambridge, and used to play the overture to <i>Atalanta</i>,
arranged by Mazzinghi.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it was some time before Theobald
could bring his courage to the sticking point of actually proposing.&nbsp;
He made it quite clear that he believed himself to be much smitten,
but month after month went by, during which there was still so much
hope in Theobald that Mr Allaby dared not discover that he was able
to do his duty for himself, and was getting impatient at the number
of half-guineas he was disbursing&mdash;and yet there was no proposal.&nbsp;
Christina&rsquo;s mother assured him that she was the best daughter
in the whole world, and would be a priceless treasure to the man who
married her.&nbsp; Theobald echoed Mrs Allaby&rsquo;s sentiments with
warmth, but still, though he visited the Rectory two or three times
a week, besides coming over on Sundays&mdash;he did not propose.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She is heart-whole yet, dear Mr Pontifex,&rdquo; said Mrs Allaby,
one day, &ldquo;at least I believe she is.&nbsp; It is not for want
of admirers&mdash;oh! no&mdash;she has had her full share of these,
but she is too, too difficult to please.&nbsp; I think, however, she
would fall before a <i>great and good</i> man.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she
looked hard at Theobald, who blushed; but the days went by and still
he did not propose.</p>
<p>Another time Theobald actually took Mrs Cowey into his confidence,
and the reader may guess what account of Christina he got from her.&nbsp;
Mrs Cowey tried the jealousy manoeuvre and hinted at a possible rival.&nbsp;
Theobald was, or pretended to be, very much alarmed; a little rudimentary
pang of jealousy shot across his bosom and he began to believe with
pride that he was not only in love, but desperately in love or he would
never feel so jealous.&nbsp; Nevertheless, day after day still went
by and he did not propose.</p>
<p>The Allabys behaved with great judgement.&nbsp; They humoured him
till his retreat was practically cut off, though he still flattered
himself that it was open.&nbsp; One day about six months after Theobald
had become an almost daily visitor at the Rectory the conversation happened
to turn upon long engagements.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like long
engagements, Mr Allaby, do you?&rdquo; said Theobald imprudently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr Allaby in a pointed tone, &ldquo;nor long
courtships,&rdquo; and he gave Theobald a look which he could not pretend
to misunderstand.&nbsp; He went back to Cambridge as fast as he could
go, and in dread of the conversation with Mr Allaby which he felt to
be impending, composed the following letter which he despatched that
same afternoon by a private messenger to Crampsford.&nbsp; The letter
was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dearest Miss Christina,&mdash;I do not know whether
you have guessed the feelings that I have long entertained for you&mdash;feelings
which I have concealed as much as I could through fear of drawing you
into an engagement which, if you enter into it, must be prolonged for
a considerable time, but, however this may be, it is out of my power
to conceal them longer; I love you, ardently, devotedly, and send these
few lines asking you to be my wife, because I dare not trust my tongue
to give adequate expression to the magnitude of my affection for you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot pretend to offer you a heart which has never known
either love or disappointment.&nbsp; I have loved already, and my heart
was years in recovering from the grief I felt at seeing her become another&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
That, however, is over, and having seen yourself I rejoice over a disappointment
which I thought at one time would have been fatal to me.&nbsp; It has
left me a less ardent lover than I should perhaps otherwise have been,
but it has increased tenfold my power of appreciating your many charms
and my desire that you should become my wife.&nbsp; Please let me have
a few lines of answer by the bearer to let me know whether or not my
suit is accepted.&nbsp; If you accept me I will at once come and talk
the matter over with Mr and Mrs Allaby, whom I shall hope one day to
be allowed to call father and mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to warn you that in the event of your consenting to
be my wife it may be years before our union can be consummated, for
I cannot marry till a college living is offered me.&nbsp; If, therefore,
you see fit to reject me, I shall be grieved rather than surprised.&mdash;Ever
most devotedly yours,</p>
<p>&ldquo;THEOBALD PONTIFEX.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this was all that his public school and University education
had been able to do for Theobald!&nbsp; Nevertheless for his own part
he thought his letter rather a good one, and congratulated himself in
particular upon his cleverness in inventing the story of a previous
attachment, behind which he intended to shelter himself if Christina
should complain of any lack of fervour in his behaviour to her.</p>
<p>I need not give Christina&rsquo;s answer, which of course was to
accept.&nbsp; Much as Theobald feared old Mr Allaby I do not think he
would have wrought up his courage to the point of actually proposing
but for the fact of the engagement being necessarily a long one, during
which a dozen things might turn up to break it off.&nbsp; However much
he may have disapproved of long engagements for other people, I doubt
whether he had any particular objection to them in his own case.&nbsp;
A pair of lovers are like sunset and sunrise: there are such things
every day but we very seldom see them.&nbsp; Theobald posed as the most
ardent lover imaginable, but, to use the vulgarism for the moment in
fashion, it was all &ldquo;side.&rdquo;&nbsp; Christina was in love,
as indeed she had been twenty times already.&nbsp; But then Christina
was impressionable and could not even hear the name &ldquo;Missolonghi&rdquo;
mentioned without bursting into tears.&nbsp; When Theobald accidentally
left his sermon case behind him one Sunday, she slept with it in her
bosom and was forlorn when she had as it were to disgorge it on the
following Sunday; but I do not think Theobald ever took so much as an
old toothbrush of Christina&rsquo;s to bed with him.&nbsp; Why, I knew
a young man once who got hold of his mistress&rsquo;s skates and slept
with them for a fortnight and cried when he had to give them up.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p>Theobald&rsquo;s engagement was all very well as far as it went,
but there was an old gentleman with a bald head and rosy cheeks in a
counting-house in Paternoster Row who must sooner or later be told of
what his son had in view, and Theobald&rsquo;s heart fluttered when
he asked himself what view this old gentleman was likely to take of
the situation.&nbsp; The murder, however, had to come out, and Theobald
and his intended, perhaps imprudently, resolved on making a clean breast
of it at once.&nbsp; He wrote what he and Christina, who helped him
to draft the letter, thought to be everything that was filial, and expressed
himself as anxious to be married with the least possible delay.&nbsp;
He could not help saying this, as Christina was at his shoulder, and
he knew it was safe, for his father might be trusted not to help him.&nbsp;
He wound up by asking his father to use any influence that might be
at his command to help him to get a living, inasmuch as it might be
years before a college living fell vacant, and he saw no other chance
of being able to marry, for neither he nor his intended had any money
except Theobald&rsquo;s fellowship, which would, of course, lapse on
his taking a wife.</p>
<p>Any step of Theobald&rsquo;s was sure to be objectionable in his
father&rsquo;s eyes, but that at three-and-twenty he should want to
marry a penniless girl who was four years older than himself, afforded
a golden opportunity which the old gentleman&mdash;for so I may now
call him, as he was at least sixty&mdash;embraced with characteristic
eagerness.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The ineffable folly,&rdquo; he wrote, on receiving
his son&rsquo;s letter, &ldquo;of your fancied passion for Miss Allaby
fills me with the gravest apprehensions.&nbsp; Making every allowance
for a lover&rsquo;s blindness, I still have no doubt that the lady herself
is a well-conducted and amiable young person, who would not disgrace
our family, but were she ten times more desirable as a daughter-in-law
than I can allow myself to hope, your joint poverty is an insuperable
objection to your marriage.&nbsp; I have four other children besides
yourself, and my expenses do not permit me to save money.&nbsp; This
year they have been especially heavy, indeed I have had to purchase
two not inconsiderable pieces of land which happened to come into the
market and were necessary to complete a property which I have long wanted
to round off in this way.&nbsp; I gave you an education regardless of
expense, which has put you in possession of a comfortable income, at
an age when many young men are dependent.&nbsp; I have thus started
you fairly in life, and may claim that you should cease to be a drag
upon me further.&nbsp; Long engagements are proverbially unsatisfactory,
and in the present case the prospect seems interminable.&nbsp; What
interest, pray, do you suppose I have that I could get a living for
you?&nbsp; Can I go up and down the country begging people to provide
for my son because he has taken it into his head to want to get married
without sufficient means?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not wish to write unkindly, nothing can be farther from
my real feelings towards you, but there is often more kindness in plain
speaking than in any amount of soft words which can end in no substantial
performance.&nbsp; Of course, I bear in mind that you are of age, and
can therefore please yourself, but if you choose to claim the strict
letter of the law, and act without consideration for your father&rsquo;s
feelings, you must not be surprised if you one day find that I have
claimed a like liberty for myself.&mdash;Believe me, your affectionate
father, G. PONTIFEX.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found this letter along with those already given and a few more
which I need not give, but throughout which the same tone prevails,
and in all of which there is the more or less obvious shake of the will
near the end of the letter.&nbsp; Remembering Theobald&rsquo;s general
dumbness concerning his father for the many years I knew him after his
father&rsquo;s death, there was an eloquence in the preservation of
the letters and in their endorsement &ldquo;Letters from my father,&rdquo;
which seemed to have with it some faint odour of health and nature.</p>
<p>Theobald did not show his father&rsquo;s letter to Christina, nor,
indeed, I believe to anyone.&nbsp; He was by nature secretive, and had
been repressed too much and too early to be capable of railing or blowing
off steam where his father was concerned.&nbsp; His sense of wrong was
still inarticulate, felt as a dull dead weight ever present day by day,
and if he woke at night-time still continually present, but he hardly
knew what it was.&nbsp; I was about the closest friend he had, and I
saw but little of him, for I could not get on with him for long together.&nbsp;
He said I had no reverence; whereas I thought that I had plenty of reverence
for what deserved to be revered, but that the gods which he deemed golden
were in reality made of baser metal.&nbsp; He never, as I have said,
complained of his father to me, and his only other friends were, like
himself, staid and prim, of evangelical tendencies, and deeply imbued
with a sense of the sinfulness of any act of insubordination to parents&mdash;good
young men, in fact&mdash;and one cannot blow off steam to a good young
man.</p>
<p>When Christina was informed by her lover of his father&rsquo;s opposition,
and of the time which must probably elapse before they could be married,
she offered&mdash;with how much sincerity I know not&mdash;to set him
free from his engagement; but Theobald declined to be released&mdash;&ldquo;not
at least,&rdquo; as he said, &ldquo;at present.&rdquo;&nbsp; Christina
and Mrs Allaby knew they could manage him, and on this not very satisfactory
footing the engagement was continued.</p>
<p>His engagement and his refusal to be released at once raised Theobald
in his own good opinion.&nbsp; Dull as he was, he had no small share
of quiet self-approbation.&nbsp; He admired himself for his University
distinction, for the purity of his life (I said of him once that if
he had only a better temper he would be as innocent as a new-laid egg)
and for his unimpeachable integrity in money matters.&nbsp; He did not
despair of advancement in the Church when he had once got a living,
and of course it was within the bounds of possibility that he might
one day become a Bishop, and Christina said she felt convinced that
this would ultimately be the case.</p>
<p>As was natural for the daughter and intended wife of a clergyman,
Christina&rsquo;s thoughts ran much upon religion, and she was resolved
that even though an exalted position in this world were denied to her
and Theobald, their virtues should be fully appreciated in the next.&nbsp;
Her religious opinions coincided absolutely with Theobald&rsquo;s own,
and many a conversation did she have with him about the glory of God,
and the completeness with which they would devote themselves to it,
as soon as Theobald had got his living and they were married.&nbsp;
So certain was she of the great results which would then ensue that
she wondered at times at the blindness shown by Providence towards its
own truest interests in not killing off the rectors who stood between
Theobald and his living a little faster.</p>
<p>In those days people believed with a simple downrightness which I
do not observe among educated men and women now.&nbsp; It had never
so much as crossed Theobald&rsquo;s mind to doubt the literal accuracy
of any syllable in the Bible.&nbsp; He had never seen any book in which
this was disputed, nor met with anyone who doubted it.&nbsp; True, there
was just a little scare about geology, but there was nothing in it.&nbsp;
If it was said that God made the world in six days, why He did make
it in six days, neither in more nor less; if it was said that He put
Adam to sleep, took out one of his ribs and made a woman of it, why
it was so as a matter of course.&nbsp; He, Adam, went to sleep as it
might be himself, Theobald Pontifex, in a garden, as it might be the
garden at Crampsford Rectory during the summer months when it was so
pretty, only that it was larger, and had some tame wild animals in it.&nbsp;
Then God came up to him, as it might be Mr Allaby or his father, dexterously
took out one of his ribs without waking him, and miraculously healed
the wound so that no trace of the operation remained.&nbsp; Finally,
God had taken the rib perhaps into the greenhouse, and had turned it
into just such another young woman as Christina.&nbsp; That was how
it was done; there was neither difficulty nor shadow of difficulty about
the matter.&nbsp; Could not God do anything He liked, and had He not
in His own inspired Book told us that He had done this?</p>
<p>This was the average attitude of fairly educated young men and women
towards the Mosaic cosmogony fifty, forty, or even twenty years ago.&nbsp;
The combating of infidelity, therefore, offered little scope for enterprising
young clergymen, nor had the Church awakened to the activity which she
has since displayed among the poor in our large towns.&nbsp; These were
then left almost without an effort at resistance or co-operation to
the labours of those who had succeeded Wesley.&nbsp; Missionary work
indeed in heathen countries was being carried on with some energy, but
Theobald did not feel any call to be a missionary.&nbsp; Christina suggested
this to him more than once, and assured him of the unspeakable happiness
it would be to her to be the wife of a missionary, and to share his
dangers; she and Theobald might even be martyred; of course they would
be martyred simultaneously, and martyrdom many years hence as regarded
from the arbour in the Rectory garden was not painful, it would ensure
them a glorious future in the next world, and at any rate posthumous
renown in this&mdash;even if they were not miraculously restored to
life again&mdash;and such things had happened ere now in the case of
martyrs.&nbsp; Theobald, however, had not been kindled by Christina&rsquo;s
enthusiasm, so she fell back upon the Church of Rome&mdash;an enemy
more dangerous, if possible, than paganism itself.&nbsp; A combat with
Romanism might even yet win for her and Theobald the crown of martyrdom.&nbsp;
True, the Church of Rome was tolerably quiet just then, but it was the
calm before the storm, of this she was assured, with a conviction deeper
than she could have attained by any argument founded upon mere reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We, dearest Theobald,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;will be
ever faithful.&nbsp; We will stand firm and support one another even
in the hour of death itself.&nbsp; God in his mercy may spare us from
being burnt alive.&nbsp; He may or may not do so.&nbsp; Oh Lord&rdquo;
(and she turned her eyes prayerfully to Heaven), &ldquo;spare my Theobald,
or grant that he may be beheaded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest,&rdquo; said Theobald gravely, &ldquo;do not let
us agitate ourselves unduly.&nbsp; If the hour of trial comes we shall
be best prepared to meet it by having led a quiet unobtrusive life of
self-denial and devotion to God&rsquo;s glory.&nbsp; Such a life let
us pray God that it may please Him to enable us to pray that we may
lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest Theobald,&rdquo; exclaimed Christina, drying the tears
that had gathered in her eyes, &ldquo;you are always, always right.&nbsp;
Let us be self-denying, pure, upright, truthful in word and deed.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She clasped her hands and looked up to Heaven as she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; rejoined her lover, &ldquo;we have ever hitherto
endeavoured to be all of these things; we have not been worldly people;
let us watch and pray that we may so continue to the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moon had risen and the arbour was getting damp, so they adjourned
further aspirations for a more convenient season.&nbsp; At other times
Christina pictured herself and Theobald as braving the scorn of almost
every human being in the achievement of some mighty task which should
redound to the honour of her Redeemer.&nbsp; She could face anything
for this.&nbsp; But always towards the end of her vision there came
a little coronation scene high up in the golden regions of the Heavens,
and a diadem was set upon her head by the Son of Man Himself, amid a
host of angels and archangels who looked on with envy and admiration&mdash;and
here even Theobald himself was out of it.&nbsp; If there could be such
a thing as the Mammon of Righteousness Christina would have assuredly
made friends with it.&nbsp; Her papa and mamma were very estimable people
and would in the course of time receive Heavenly Mansions in which they
would be exceedingly comfortable; so doubtless would her sisters; so
perhaps, even might her brothers; but for herself she felt that a higher
destiny was preparing, which it was her duty never to lose sight of.&nbsp;
The first step towards it would be her marriage with Theobald.&nbsp;
In spite, however, of these flights of religious romanticism, Christina
was a good-tempered kindly-natured girl enough, who, if she had married
a sensible layman&mdash;we will say a hotel-keeper&mdash;would have
developed into a good landlady and been deservedly popular with her
guests.</p>
<p>Such was Theobald&rsquo;s engaged life.&nbsp; Many a little present
passed between the pair, and many a small surprise did they prepare
pleasantly for one another.&nbsp; They never quarrelled, and neither
of them ever flirted with anyone else.&nbsp; Mrs Allaby and his future
sisters-in-law idolised Theobald in spite of its being impossible to
get another deacon to come and be played for as long as Theobald was
able to help Mr Allaby, which now of course he did free gratis and for
nothing; two of the sisters, however, did manage to find husbands before
Christina was actually married, and on each occasion Theobald played
the part of decoy elephant.&nbsp; In the end only two out of the seven
daughters remained single.</p>
<p>After three or four years, old Mr Pontifex became accustomed to his
son&rsquo;s engagement and looked upon it as among the things which
had now a prescriptive right to toleration.&nbsp; In the spring of 1831,
more than five years after Theobald had first walked over to Crampsford,
one of the best livings in the gift of the College unexpectedly fell
vacant, and was for various reasons declined by the two fellows senior
to Theobald, who might each have been expected to take it.&nbsp; The
living was then offered to and of course accepted by Theobald, being
in value not less than &pound;500 a year with a suitable house and garden.&nbsp;
Old Mr Pontifex then came down more handsomely than was expected and
settled &pound;10,000 on his son and daughter-in-law for life with remainder
to such of their issue as they might appoint.&nbsp; In the month of
July, 1831 Theobald and Christina became man and wife.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p>A due number of old shoes had been thrown at the carriage in which
the happy pair departed from the Rectory, and it had turned the corner
at the bottom of the village.&nbsp; It could then be seen for two or
three hundred yards creeping past a fir coppice, and after this was
lost to view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; said Mr Allaby to his man-servant, &ldquo;shut
the gate;&rdquo; and he went indoors with a sigh of relief which seemed
to say: &ldquo;I have done it, and I am alive.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
the reaction after a burst of enthusiastic merriment during which the
old gentleman had run twenty yards after the carriage to fling a slipper
at it&mdash;which he had duly flung.</p>
<p>But what were the feelings of Theobald and Christina when the village
was passed and they were rolling quietly by the fir plantation?&nbsp;
It is at this point that even the stoutest heart must fail, unless it
beat in the breast of one who is over head and ears in love.&nbsp; If
a young man is in a small boat on a choppy sea, along with his affianced
bride and both are sea-sick, and if the sick swain can forget his own
anguish in the happiness of holding the fair one&rsquo;s head when she
is at her worst&mdash;then he is in love, and his heart will be in no
danger of failing him as he passes his fir plantation.&nbsp; Other people,
and unfortunately by far the greater number of those who get married
must be classed among the &ldquo;other people,&rdquo; will inevitably
go through a quarter or half an hour of greater or less badness as the
case may be.&nbsp; Taking numbers into account, I should think more
mental suffering had been undergone in the streets leading from St George&rsquo;s,
Hanover Square, than in the condemned cells of Newgate.&nbsp; There
is no time at which what the Italians call <i>la figlia della Morte</i>
lays her cold hand upon a man more awfully than during the first half
hour that he is alone with a woman whom he has married but never genuinely
loved.</p>
<p>Death&rsquo;s daughter did not spare Theobald.&nbsp; He had behaved
very well hitherto.&nbsp; When Christina had offered to let him go,
he had stuck to his post with a magnanimity on which he had plumed himself
ever since.&nbsp; From that time forward he had said to himself: &ldquo;I,
at any rate, am the very soul of honour; I am not,&rdquo; etc., etc.&nbsp;
True, at the moment of magnanimity the actual cash payment, so to speak,
was still distant; when his father gave formal consent to his marriage
things began to look more serious; when the college living had fallen
vacant and been accepted they looked more serious still; but when Christina
actually named the day, then Theobald&rsquo;s heart fainted within him.</p>
<p>The engagement had gone on so long that he had got into a groove,
and the prospect of change was disconcerting.&nbsp; Christina and he
had got on, he thought to himself, very nicely for a great number of
years; why&mdash;why&mdash;why should they not continue to go on as
they were doing now for the rest of their lives?&nbsp; But there was
no more chance of escape for him than for the sheep which is being driven
to the butcher&rsquo;s back premises, and like the sheep he felt that
there was nothing to be gained by resistance, so he made none.&nbsp;
He behaved, in fact, with decency, and was declared on all hands to
be one of the happiest men imaginable.</p>
<p>Now, however, to change the metaphor, the drop had actually fallen,
and the poor wretch was hanging in mid air along with the creature of
his affections.&nbsp; This creature was now thirty-three years old,
and looked it: she had been weeping, and her eyes and nose were reddish;
if &ldquo;I have done it and I am alive,&rdquo; was written on Mr Allaby&rsquo;s
face after he had thrown the shoe, &ldquo;I have done it, and I do not
see how I can possibly live much longer&rdquo; was upon the face of
Theobald as he was being driven along by the fir Plantation.&nbsp; This,
however, was not apparent at the Rectory.&nbsp; All that could be seen
there was the bobbing up and down of the postilion&rsquo;s head, which
just over-topped the hedge by the roadside as he rose in his stirrups,
and the black and yellow body of the carriage.</p>
<p>For some time the pair said nothing: what they must have felt during
their first half hour, the reader must guess, for it is beyond my power
to tell him; at the end of that time, however, Theobald had rummaged
up a conclusion from some odd corner of his soul to the effect that
now he and Christina were married the sooner they fell into their future
mutual relations the better.&nbsp; If people who are in a difficulty
will only do the first little reasonable thing which they can clearly
recognise as reasonable, they will always find the next step more easy
both to see and take.&nbsp; What, then, thought Theobald, was here at
this moment the first and most obvious matter to be considered, and
what would be an equitable view of his and Christina&rsquo;s relative
positions in respect to it?&nbsp; Clearly their first dinner was their
first joint entry into the duties and pleasures of married life.&nbsp;
No less clearly it was Christina&rsquo;s duty to order it, and his own
to eat it and pay for it.</p>
<p>The arguments leading to this conclusion, and the conclusion itself,
flashed upon Theobald about three and a half miles after he had left
Crampsford on the road to Newmarket.&nbsp; He had breakfasted early,
but his usual appetite had failed him.&nbsp; They had left the vicarage
at noon without staying for the wedding breakfast.&nbsp; Theobald liked
an early dinner; it dawned upon him that he was beginning to be hungry;
from this to the conclusion stated in the preceding paragraph the steps
had been easy.&nbsp; After a few minutes&rsquo; further reflection he
broached the matter to his bride, and thus the ice was broken.</p>
<p>Mrs Theobald was not prepared for so sudden an assumption of importance.&nbsp;
Her nerves, never of the strongest, had been strung to their highest
tension by the event of the morning.&nbsp; She wanted to escape observation;
she was conscious of looking a little older than she quite liked to
look as a bride who had been married that morning; she feared the landlady,
the chamber-maid, the waiter&mdash;everybody and everything; her heart
beat so fast that she could hardly speak, much less go through the ordeal
of ordering dinner in a strange hotel with a strange landlady.&nbsp;
She begged and prayed to be let off.&nbsp; If Theobald would only order
dinner this once, she would order it any day and every day in future.</p>
<p>But the inexorable Theobald was not to be put off with such absurd
excuses.&nbsp; He was master now.&nbsp; Had not Christina less than
two hours ago promised solemnly to honour and obey him, and was she
turning restive over such a trifle as this?&nbsp; The loving smile departed
from his face, and was succeeded by a scowl which that old Turk, his
father, might have envied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stuff and nonsense, my dearest
Christina,&rdquo; he exclaimed mildly, and stamped his foot upon the
floor of the carriage.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a wife&rsquo;s duty to order
her husband&rsquo;s dinner; you are my wife, and I shall expect you
to order mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; For Theobald was nothing if he was not logical.</p>
<p>The bride began to cry, and said he was unkind; whereon he said nothing,
but revolved unutterable things in his heart.&nbsp; Was this, then,
the end of his six years of unflagging devotion?&nbsp; Was it for this
that when Christina had offered to let him off, he had stuck to his
engagement?&nbsp; Was this the outcome of her talks about duty and spiritual
mindedness&mdash;that now upon the very day of her marriage she should
fail to see that the first step in obedience to God lay in obedience
to himself?&nbsp; He would drive back to Crampsford; he would complain
to Mr and Mrs Allaby; he didn&rsquo;t mean to have married Christina;
he hadn&rsquo;t married her; it was all a hideous dream; he would&mdash;But
a voice kept ringing in his ears which said: &ldquo;YOU CAN&rsquo;T,
CAN&rsquo;T, CAN&rsquo;T.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;CAN&rsquo;T I?&rdquo; screamed the unhappy creature to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the remorseless voice, &ldquo;YOU CAN&rsquo;T.&nbsp;
YOU ARE A MARRIED MAN.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rolled back in his corner of the carriage and for the first time
felt how iniquitous were the marriage laws of England.&nbsp; But he
would buy Milton&rsquo;s prose works and read his pamphlet on divorce.&nbsp;
He might perhaps be able to get them at Newmarket.</p>
<p>So the bride sat crying in one corner of the carriage; and the bridegroom
sulked in the other, and he feared her as only a bridegroom can fear.</p>
<p>Presently, however, a feeble voice was heard from the bride&rsquo;s
corner saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest Theobald&mdash;dearest Theobald, forgive me; I have
been very, very wrong.&nbsp; Please do not be angry with me.&nbsp; I
will order the&mdash;the&mdash;&rdquo; but the word &ldquo;dinner&rdquo;
was checked by rising sobs.</p>
<p>When Theobald heard these words a load began to be lifted from his
heart, but he only looked towards her, and that not too pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please tell me,&rdquo; continued the voice, &ldquo;what you
think you would like, and I will tell the landlady when we get to Newmar&mdash;&rdquo;
but another burst of sobs checked the completion of the word.</p>
<p>The load on Theobald&rsquo;s heart grew lighter and lighter.&nbsp;
Was it possible that she might not be going to henpeck him after all?&nbsp;
Besides, had she not diverted his attention from herself to his approaching
dinner?</p>
<p>He swallowed down more of his apprehensions and said, but still gloomily,
&ldquo;I think we might have a roast fowl with bread sauce, new potatoes
and green peas, and then we will see if they could let us have a cherry
tart and some cream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few minutes more he drew her towards him, kissed away her
tears, and assured her that he knew she would be a good wife to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest Theobald,&rdquo; she exclaimed in answer, &ldquo;you
are an angel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Theobald believed her, and in ten minutes more the happy couple alighted
at the inn at Newmarket.</p>
<p>Bravely did Christina go through her arduous task.&nbsp; Eagerly
did she beseech the landlady, in secret, not to keep her Theobald waiting
longer than was absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have any soup ready, you know, Mrs Barber, it might
save ten minutes, for we might have it while the fowl was browning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>See how necessity had nerved her!&nbsp; But in truth she had a splitting
headache, and would have given anything to have been alone.</p>
<p>The dinner was a success.&nbsp; A pint of sherry had warmed Theobald&rsquo;s
heart, and he began to hope that, after all, matters might still go
well with him.&nbsp; He had conquered in the first battle, and this
gives great prestige.&nbsp; How easy it had been too!&nbsp; Why had
he never treated his sisters in this way?&nbsp; He would do so next
time he saw them; he might in time be able to stand up to his brother
John, or even his father.&nbsp; Thus do we build castles in air when
flushed with wine and conquest.</p>
<p>The end of the honeymoon saw Mrs Theobald the most devotedly obsequious
wife in all England.&nbsp; According to the old saying, Theobald had
killed the cat at the beginning.&nbsp; It had been a very little cat,
a mere kitten in fact, or he might have been afraid to face it, but
such as it had been he had challenged it to mortal combat, and had held
up its dripping head defiantly before his wife&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; The
rest had been easy.</p>
<p>Strange that one whom I have described hitherto as so timid and easily
put upon should prove such a Tartar all of a sudden on the day of his
marriage.&nbsp; Perhaps I have passed over his years of courtship too
rapidly.&nbsp; During these he had become a tutor of his college, and
had at last been Junior Dean.&nbsp; I never yet knew a man whose sense
of his own importance did not become adequately developed after he had
held a resident fellowship for five or six years.&nbsp; True&mdash;immediately
on arriving within a ten mile radius of his father&rsquo;s house, an
enchantment fell upon him, so that his knees waxed weak, his greatness
departed, and he again felt himself like an overgrown baby under a perpetual
cloud; but then he was not often at Elmhurst, and as soon as he left
it the spell was taken off again; once more he became the fellow and
tutor of his college, the Junior Dean, the betrothed of Christina, the
idol of the Allaby womankind.&nbsp; From all which it may be gathered
that if Christina had been a Barbary hen, and had ruffled her feathers
in any show of resistance Theobald would not have ventured to swagger
with her, but she was not a Barbary hen, she was only a common hen,
and that too with rather a smaller share of personal bravery than hens
generally have.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p>Battersby-On-The-Hill was the name of the village of which Theobald
was now Rector.&nbsp; It contained 400 or 500 inhabitants, scattered
over a rather large area, and consisting entirely of farmers and agricultural
labourers.&nbsp; The Rectory was commodious, and placed on the brow
of a hill which gave it a delightful prospect.&nbsp; There was a fair
sprinkling of neighbours within visiting range, but with one or two
exceptions they were the clergymen and clergymen&rsquo;s families of
the surrounding villages.</p>
<p>By these the Pontifexes were welcomed as great acquisitions to the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Mr Pontifex, they said was so clever; he had been
senior classic and senior wrangler; a perfect genius in fact, and yet
with so much sound practical common sense as well.&nbsp; As son of such
a distinguished man as the great Mr Pontifex the publisher he would
come into a large property by-and-by.&nbsp; Was there not an elder brother?&nbsp;
Yes, but there would be so much that Theobald would probably get something
very considerable.&nbsp; Of course they would give dinner parties.&nbsp;
And Mrs Pontifex, what a charming woman she was; she was certainly not
exactly pretty perhaps, but then she had such a sweet smile and her
manner was so bright and winning.&nbsp; She was so devoted too to her
husband and her husband to her; they really did come up to one&rsquo;s
ideas of what lovers used to be in days of old; it was rare to meet
with such a pair in these degenerate times; it was quite beautiful,
etc., etc.&nbsp; Such were the comments of the neighbours on the new
arrivals.</p>
<p>As for Theobald&rsquo;s own parishioners, the farmers were civil
and the labourers and their wives obsequious.&nbsp; There was a little
dissent, the legacy of a careless predecessor, but as Mrs Theobald said
proudly, &ldquo;I think Theobald may be trusted to deal with <i>that</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The church was then an interesting specimen of late Norman, with some
early English additions.&nbsp; It was what in these days would be called
in a very bad state of repair, but forty or fifty years ago few churches
were in good repair.&nbsp; If there is one feature more characteristic
of the present generation than another it is that it has been a great
restorer of churches.</p>
<p>Horace preached church restoration in his ode:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Delicta majorum immeritus lues,<br />
Romane, donec templa refeceris<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Aedesque labentes deorum et<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foeda nigro simulacra fumo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing went right with Rome for long together after the Augustan
age, but whether it was because she did restore the temples or because
she did not restore them I know not.&nbsp; They certainly went all wrong
after Constantine&rsquo;s time and yet Rome is still a city of some
importance.</p>
<p>I may say here that before Theobald had been many years at Battersby
he found scope for useful work in the rebuilding of Battersby church,
which he carried out at considerable cost, towards which he subscribed
liberally himself.&nbsp; He was his own architect, and this saved expense;
but architecture was not very well understood about the year 1834, when
Theobald commenced operations, and the result is not as satisfactory
as it would have been if he had waited a few years longer.</p>
<p>Every man&rsquo;s work, whether it be literature or music or pictures
or architecture or anything else, is always a portrait of himself, and
the more he tries to conceal himself the more clearly will his character
appear in spite of him.&nbsp; I may very likely be condemning myself,
all the time that I am writing this book, for I know that whether I
like it or no I am portraying myself more surely than I am portraying
any of the characters whom I set before the reader.&nbsp; I am sorry
that it is so, but I cannot help it&mdash;after which sop to Nemesis
I will say that Battersby church in its amended form has always struck
me as a better portrait of Theobald than any sculptor or painter short
of a great master would be able to produce.</p>
<p>I remember staying with Theobald some six or seven months after he
was married, and while the old church was still standing.&nbsp; I went
to church, and felt as Naaman must have felt on certain occasions when
he had to accompany his master on his return after having been cured
of his leprosy.&nbsp; I have carried away a more vivid recollection
of this and of the people, than of Theobald&rsquo;s sermon.&nbsp; Even
now I can see the men in blue smock frocks reaching to their heels,
and more than one old woman in a scarlet cloak; the row of stolid, dull,
vacant plough-boys, ungainly in build, uncomely in face, lifeless, apathetic,
a race a good deal more like the pre-revolution French peasant as described
by Carlyle than is pleasant to reflect upon&mdash;a race now supplanted
by a smarter, comelier and more hopeful generation, which has discovered
that it too has a right to as much happiness as it can get, and with
clearer ideas about the best means of getting it.</p>
<p>They shamble in one after another, with steaming breath, for it is
winter, and loud clattering of hob-nailed boots; they beat the snow
from off them as they enter, and through the opened door I catch a momentary
glimpse of a dreary leaden sky and snow-clad tombstones.&nbsp; Somehow
or other I find the strain which Handel has wedded to the words &ldquo;There
the ploughman near at hand,&rdquo; has got into my head and there is
no getting it out again.&nbsp; How marvellously old Handel understood
these people!</p>
<p>They bob to Theobald as they passed the reading desk (&ldquo;The
people hereabouts are truly respectful,&rdquo; whispered Christina to
me, &ldquo;they know their betters.&rdquo;), and take their seats in
a long row against the wall.&nbsp; The choir clamber up into the gallery
with their instruments&mdash;a violoncello, a clarinet and a trombone.&nbsp;
I see them and soon I hear them, for there is a hymn before the service,
a wild strain, a remnant, if I mistake not, of some pre-Reformation
litany.&nbsp; I have heard what I believe was its remote musical progenitor
in the church of SS. Giovanni e Paolo at Venice not five years since;
and again I have heard it far away in mid-Atlantic upon a grey sea-Sabbath
in June, when neither winds nor waves are stirring, so that the emigrants
gather on deck, and their plaintive psalm goes forth upon the silver
haze of the sky, and on the wilderness of a sea that has sighed till
it can sigh no longer.&nbsp; Or it may be heard at some Methodist Camp
Meeting upon a Welsh hillside, but in the churches it is gone for ever.&nbsp;
If I were a musician I would take it as the subject for the <i>adagio</i>
in a Wesleyan symphony.</p>
<p>Gone now are the clarinet, the violoncello and the trombone, wild
minstrelsy as of the doleful creatures in Ezekiel, discordant, but infinitely
pathetic.&nbsp; Gone is that scarebabe stentor, that bellowing bull
of Bashan the village blacksmith, gone is the melodious carpenter, gone
the brawny shepherd with the red hair, who roared more lustily than
all, until they came to the words, &ldquo;Shepherds with your flocks
abiding,&rdquo; when modesty covered him with confusion, and compelled
him to be silent, as though his own health were being drunk.&nbsp; They
were doomed and had a presentiment of evil, even when first I saw them,
but they had still a little lease of choir life remaining, and they
roared out</p>
<blockquote><p>[wick-ed hands have pierced and nailed him, pierced and
nailed him to a tree.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but no description can give a proper idea of the effect.&nbsp; When
I was last in Battersby church there was a harmonium played by a sweet-looking
girl with a choir of school children around her, and they chanted the
canticles to the most correct of chants, and they sang Hymns Ancient
and Modern; the high pews were gone, nay, the very gallery in which
the old choir had sung was removed as an accursed thing which might
remind the people of the high places, and Theobald was old, and Christina
was lying under the yew trees in the churchyard.</p>
<p>But in the evening later on I saw three very old men come chuckling
out of a dissenting chapel, and surely enough they were my old friends
the blacksmith, the carpenter and the shepherd.&nbsp; There was a look
of content upon their faces which made me feel certain they had been
singing; not doubtless with the old glory of the violoncello, the clarinet
and the trombone, but still songs of Sion and no new fangled papistry.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<p>The hymn had engaged my attention; when it was over I had time to
take stock of the congregation.&nbsp; They were chiefly farmers&mdash;fat,
very well-to-do folk, who had come some of them with their wives and
children from outlying farms two and three miles away; haters of popery
and of anything which any one might choose to say was popish; good,
sensible fellows who detested theory of any kind, whose ideal was the
maintenance of the <i>status quo</i> with perhaps a loving reminiscence
of old war times, and a sense of wrong that the weather was not more
completely under their control, who desired higher prices and cheaper
wages, but otherwise were most contented when things were changing least;
tolerators, if not lovers, of all that was familiar, haters of all that
was unfamiliar; they would have been equally horrified at hearing the
Christian religion doubted, and at seeing it practised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can there be in common between Theobald and his parishioners?&rdquo;
said Christina to me, in the course of the evening, when her husband
was for a few moments absent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course one must not complain,
but I assure you it grieves me to see a man of Theobald&rsquo;s ability
thrown away upon such a place as this.&nbsp; If we had only been at
Gaysbury, where there are the A&rsquo;s, the B&rsquo;s, the C&rsquo;s,
and Lord D&rsquo;s place, as you know, quite close, I should not then
have felt that we were living in such a desert; but I suppose it is
for the best,&rdquo; she added more cheerfully; &ldquo;and then of course
the Bishop will come to us whenever he is in the neighbourhood, and
if we were at Gaysbury he might have gone to Lord D&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps I have now said enough to indicate the kind of place in which
Theobald&rsquo;s lines were cast, and the sort of woman he had married.&nbsp;
As for his own habits, I see him trudging through muddy lanes and over
long sweeps of plover-haunted pastures to visit a dying cottager&rsquo;s
wife.&nbsp; He takes her meat and wine from his own table, and that
not a little only but liberally.&nbsp; According to his lights also,
he administers what he is pleased to call spiritual consolation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I&rsquo;m going to Hell, Sir,&rdquo; says the
sick woman with a whine.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Sir, save me, save me, don&rsquo;t
let me go there.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t stand it, Sir, I should die
with fear, the very thought of it drives me into a cold sweat all over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs Thompson,&rdquo; says Theobald gravely, &ldquo;you must
have faith in the precious blood of your Redeemer; it is He alone who
can save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are you sure, Sir,&rdquo; says she, looking wistfully
at him, &ldquo;that He will forgive me&mdash;for I&rsquo;ve not been
a very good woman, indeed I haven&rsquo;t&mdash;and if God would only
say &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; outright with His mouth when I ask whether my
sins are forgiven me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they <i>are</i> forgiven you, Mrs Thompson,&rdquo; says
Theobald with some sternness, for the same ground has been gone over
a good many times already, and he has borne the unhappy woman&rsquo;s
misgivings now for a full quarter of an hour.&nbsp; Then he puts a stop
to the conversation by repeating prayers taken from the &ldquo;Visitation
of the Sick,&rdquo; and overawes the poor wretch from expressing further
anxiety as to her condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell me, Sir,&rdquo; she exclaims piteously,
as she sees that he is preparing to go away, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you
tell me that there is no Day of Judgement, and that there is no such
place as Hell?&nbsp; I can do without the Heaven, Sir, but I cannot
do with the Hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; Theobald is much shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs Thompson,&rdquo; he rejoins impressively, &ldquo;let me
implore you to suffer no doubt concerning these two cornerstones of
our religion to cross your mind at a moment like the present.&nbsp;
If there is one thing more certain than another it is that we shall
all appear before the Judgement Seat of Christ, and that the wicked
will be consumed in a lake of everlasting fire.&nbsp; Doubt this, Mrs
Thompson, and you are lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor woman buries her fevered head in the coverlet in a paroxysm
of fear which at last finds relief in tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs Thompson,&rdquo; says Theobald, with his hand on the door,
&ldquo;compose yourself, be calm; you must please to take my word for
it that at the Day of Judgement your sins will be all washed white in
the blood of the Lamb, Mrs Thompson.&nbsp; Yea,&rdquo; he exclaims frantically,
&ldquo;though they be as scarlet, yet shall they be as white as wool,&rdquo;
and he makes off as fast as he can from the fetid atmosphere of the
cottage to the pure air outside.&nbsp; Oh, how thankful he is when the
interview is over!</p>
<p>He returns home, conscious that he has done his duty, and administered
the comforts of religion to a dying sinner.&nbsp; His admiring wife
awaits him at the Rectory, and assures him that never yet was clergyman
so devoted to the welfare of his flock.&nbsp; He believes her; he has
a natural tendency to believe everything that is told him, and who should
know the facts of the case better than his wife?&nbsp; Poor fellow!&nbsp;
He has done his best, but what does a fish&rsquo;s best come to when
the fish is out of water?&nbsp; He has left meat and wine&mdash;that
he can do; he will call again and will leave more meat and wine; day
after day he trudges over the same plover-haunted fields, and listens
at the end of his walk to the same agony of forebodings, which day after
day he silences, but does not remove, till at last a merciful weakness
renders the sufferer careless of her future, and Theobald is satisfied
that her mind is now peacefully at rest in Jesus.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<p>He does not like this branch of his profession&mdash;indeed he hates
it&mdash;but will not admit it to himself.&nbsp; The habit of not admitting
things to himself has become a confirmed one with him.&nbsp; Nevertheless
there haunts him an ill defined sense that life would be pleasanter
if there were no sick sinners, or if they would at any rate face an
eternity of torture with more indifference.&nbsp; He does not feel that
he is in his element.&nbsp; The farmers look as if they were in their
element.&nbsp; They are full-bodied, healthy and contented; but between
him and them there is a great gulf fixed.&nbsp; A hard and drawn look
begins to settle about the corners of his mouth, so that even if he
were not in a black coat and white tie a child might know him for a
parson.</p>
<p>He knows that he is doing his duty.&nbsp; Every day convinces him
of this more firmly; but then there is not much duty for him to do.&nbsp;
He is sadly in want of occupation.&nbsp; He has no taste for any of
those field sports which were not considered unbecoming for a clergyman
forty years ago.&nbsp; He does not ride, nor shoot, nor fish, nor course,
nor play cricket.&nbsp; Study, to do him justice, he had never really
liked, and what inducement was there for him to study at Battersby?&nbsp;
He reads neither old books nor new ones.&nbsp; He does not interest
himself in art or science or politics, but he sets his back up with
some promptness if any of them show any development unfamiliar to himself.&nbsp;
True, he writes his own sermons, but even his wife considers that his
<i>forte</i> lies rather in the example of his life (which is one long
act of self-devotion) than in his utterances from the pulpit.&nbsp;
After breakfast he retires to his study; he cuts little bits out of
the Bible and gums them with exquisite neatness by the side of other
little bits; this he calls making a Harmony of the Old and New Testaments.&nbsp;
Alongside the extracts he copies in the very perfection of hand-writing
extracts from Mede (the only man, according to Theobald, who really
understood the Book of Revelation), Patrick, and other old divines.&nbsp;
He works steadily at this for half an hour every morning during many
years, and the result is doubtless valuable.&nbsp; After some years
have gone by he hears his children their lessons, and the daily oft-repeated
screams that issue from the study during the lesson hours tell their
own horrible story over the house.&nbsp; He has also taken to collecting
a <i>hortus siccus</i>, and through the interest of his father was once
mentioned in the Saturday Magazine as having been the first to find
a plant, whose name I have forgotten, in the neighbourhood of Battersby.&nbsp;
This number of the Saturday Magazine has been bound in red morocco,
and is kept upon the drawing-room table.&nbsp; He potters about his
garden; if he hears a hen cackling he runs and tells Christina, and
straightway goes hunting for the egg.</p>
<p>When the two Miss Allabys came, as they sometimes did, to stay with
Christina, they said the life led by their sister and brother-in-law
was an idyll.&nbsp; Happy indeed was Christina in her choice, for that
she had had a choice was a fiction which soon took root among them&mdash;and
happy Theobald in his Christina.&nbsp; Somehow or other Christina was
always a little shy of cards when her sisters were staying with her,
though at other times she enjoyed a game of cribbage or a rubber of
whist heartily enough, but her sisters knew they would never be asked
to Battersby again if they were to refer to that little matter, and
on the whole it was worth their while to be asked to Battersby.&nbsp;
If Theobald&rsquo;s temper was rather irritable he did not vent it upon
them.</p>
<p>By nature reserved, if he could have found someone to cook his dinner
for him, he would rather have lived in a desert island than not.&nbsp;
In his heart of hearts he held with Pope that &ldquo;the greatest nuisance
to mankind is man&rdquo; or words to that effect&mdash;only that women,
with the exception perhaps of Christina, were worse.&nbsp; Yet for all
this when visitors called he put a better face on it than anyone who
was behind the scenes would have expected.</p>
<p>He was quick too at introducing the names of any literary celebrities
whom he had met at his father&rsquo;s house, and soon established an
all-round reputation which satisfied even Christina herself.</p>
<p>Who so <i>integer vit&aelig; scelerisque purus</i>, it was asked,
as Mr Pontifex of Battersby?&nbsp; Who so fit to be consulted if any
difficulty about parish management should arise?&nbsp; Who such a happy
mixture of the sincere uninquiring Christian and of the man of the world?&nbsp;
For so people actually called him.&nbsp; They said he was such an admirable
man of business.&nbsp; Certainly if he had said he would pay a sum of
money at a certain time, the money would be forthcoming on the appointed
day, and this is saying a good deal for any man.&nbsp; His constitutional
timidity rendered him incapable of an attempt to overreach when there
was the remotest chance of opposition or publicity, and his correct
bearing and somewhat stern expression were a great protection to him
against being overreached.&nbsp; He never talked of money, and invariably
changed the subject whenever money was introduced.&nbsp; His expression
of unutterable horror at all kinds of meanness was a sufficient guarantee
that he was not mean himself.&nbsp; Besides he had no business transactions
save of the most ordinary butcher&rsquo;s book and baker&rsquo;s book
description.&nbsp; His tastes&mdash;if he had any&mdash;were, as we
have seen, simple; he had &pound;900 a year and a house; the neighbourhood
was cheap, and for some time he had no children to be a drag upon him.&nbsp;
Who was not to be envied, and if envied why then respected, if Theobald
was not enviable?</p>
<p>Yet I imagine that Christina was on the whole happier than her husband.&nbsp;
She had not to go and visit sick parishioners, and the management of
her house and the keeping of her accounts afforded as much occupation
as she desired.&nbsp; Her principal duty was, as she well said, to her
husband&mdash;to love him, honour him, and keep him in a good temper.&nbsp;
To do her justice she fulfilled this duty to the uttermost of her power.&nbsp;
It would have been better perhaps if she had not so frequently assured
her husband that he was the best and wisest of mankind, for no one in
his little world ever dreamed of telling him anything else, and it was
not long before he ceased to have any doubt upon the matter.&nbsp; As
for his temper, which had become very violent at times, she took care
to humour it on the slightest sign of an approaching outbreak.&nbsp;
She had early found that this was much the easiest plan.&nbsp; The thunder
was seldom for herself.&nbsp; Long before her marriage even she had
studied his little ways, and knew how to add fuel to the fire as long
as the fire seemed to want it, and then to damp it judiciously down,
making as little smoke as possible.</p>
<p>In money matters she was scrupulousness itself.&nbsp; Theobald made
her a quarterly allowance for her dress, pocket money and little charities
and presents.&nbsp; In these last items she was liberal in proportion
to her income; indeed she dressed with great economy and gave away whatever
was over in presents or charity.&nbsp; Oh, what a comfort it was to
Theobald to reflect that he had a wife on whom he could rely never to
cost him a sixpence of unauthorised expenditure!&nbsp; Letting alone
her absolute submission, the perfect coincidence of her opinion with
his own upon every subject and her constant assurances to him that he
was right in everything which he took it into his head to say or do,
what a tower of strength to him was her exactness in money matters!&nbsp;
As years went by he became as fond of his wife as it was in his nature
to be of any living thing, and applauded himself for having stuck to
his engagement&mdash;a piece of virtue of which he was now reaping the
reward.&nbsp; Even when Christina did outrun her quarterly stipend by
some thirty shillings or a couple of pounds, it was always made perfectly
clear to Theobald how the deficiency had arisen&mdash;there had been
an unusually costly evening dress bought which was to last a long time,
or somebody&rsquo;s unexpected wedding had necessitated a more handsome
present than the quarter&rsquo;s balance would quite allow: the excess
of expenditure was always repaid in the following quarter or quarters
even though it were only ten shillings at a time.</p>
<p>I believe, however, that after they had been married some twenty
years, Christina had somewhat fallen from her original perfection as
regards money.&nbsp; She had got gradually in arrear during many successive
quarters, till she had contracted a chronic loan a sort of domestic
national debt, amounting to between seven and eight pounds.&nbsp; Theobald
at length felt that a remonstrance had become imperative, and took advantage
of his silver wedding day to inform Christina that her indebtedness
was cancelled, and at the same time to beg that she would endeavour
henceforth to equalise her expenditure and her income.&nbsp; She burst
into tears of love and gratitude, assured him that he was the best and
most generous of men, and never during the remainder of her married
life was she a single shilling behind hand.</p>
<p>Christina hated change of all sorts no less cordially than her husband.&nbsp;
She and Theobald had nearly everything in this world that they could
wish for; why, then, should people desire to introduce all sorts of
changes of which no one could foresee the end?&nbsp; Religion, she was
deeply convinced, had long since attained its final development, nor
could it enter into the heart of reasonable man to conceive any faith
more perfect than was inculcated by the Church of England.&nbsp; She
could imagine no position more honourable than that of a clergyman&rsquo;s
wife unless indeed it were a bishop&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Considering his father&rsquo;s
influence it was not at all impossible that Theobald might be a bishop
some day&mdash;and then&mdash;then would occur to her that one little
flaw in the practice of the Church of England&mdash;a flaw not indeed
in its doctrine, but in its policy, which she believed on the whole
to be a mistaken one in this respect.&nbsp; I mean the fact that a bishop&rsquo;s
wife does not take the rank of her husband.</p>
<p>This had been the doing of Elizabeth, who had been a bad woman, of
exceeding doubtful moral character, and at heart a Papist to the last.&nbsp;
Perhaps people ought to have been above mere considerations of worldly
dignity, but the world was as it was, and such things carried weight
with them, whether they ought to do so or no.&nbsp; Her influence as
plain Mrs Pontifex, wife, we will say, of the Bishop of Winchester,
would no doubt be considerable.&nbsp; Such a character as hers could
not fail to carry weight if she were ever in a sufficiently conspicuous
sphere for its influence to be widely felt; but as Lady Winchester&mdash;or
the Bishopess&mdash;which would sound quite nicely&mdash;who could doubt
that her power for good would be enhanced?&nbsp; And it would be all
the nicer because if she had a daughter the daughter would not be a
Bishopess unless indeed she were to marry a Bishop too, which would
not be likely.</p>
<p>These were her thoughts upon her good days; at other times she would,
to do her justice, have doubts whether she was in all respects as spiritually
minded as she ought to be.&nbsp; She must press on, press on, till every
enemy to her salvation was surmounted and Satan himself lay bruised
under her feet.&nbsp; It occurred to her on one of these occasions that
she might steal a march over some of her contemporaries if she were
to leave off eating black puddings, of which whenever they had killed
a pig she had hitherto partaken freely; and if she were also careful
that no fowls were served at her table which had had their necks wrung,
but only such as had had their throats cut and been allowed to bleed.&nbsp;
St Paul and the Church of Jerusalem had insisted upon it as necessary
that even Gentile converts should abstain from things strangled and
from blood, and they had joined this prohibition with that of a vice
about the abominable nature of which there could be no question; it
would be well therefore to abstain in future and see whether any noteworthy
spiritual result ensued.&nbsp; She did abstain, and was certain that
from the day of her resolve she had felt stronger, purer in heart, and
in all respects more spiritually minded than she had ever felt hitherto.&nbsp;
Theobald did not lay so much stress on this as she did, but as she settled
what he should have at dinner she could take care that he got no strangled
fowls; as for black puddings, happily, he had seen them made when he
was a boy, and had never got over his aversion for them.&nbsp; She wished
the matter were one of more general observance than it was; this was
just a case in which as Lady Winchester she might have been able to
do what as plain Mrs Pontifex it was hopeless even to attempt.</p>
<p>And thus this worthy couple jogged on from month to month and from
year to year.&nbsp; The reader, if he has passed middle life and has
a clerical connection, will probably remember scores and scores of rectors
and rectors&rsquo; wives who differed in no material respect from Theobald
and Christina.&nbsp; Speaking from a recollection and experience extending
over nearly eighty years from the time when I was myself a child in
the nursery of a vicarage, I should say I had drawn the better rather
than the worse side of the life of an English country parson of some
fifty years ago.&nbsp; I admit, however, that there are no such people
to be found nowadays.&nbsp; A more united or, on the whole, happier,
couple could not have been found in England.&nbsp; One grief only overshadowed
the early years of their married life: I mean the fact that no living
children were born to them.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<p>In the course of time this sorrow was removed.&nbsp; At the beginning
of the fifth year of her married life Christina was safely delivered
of a boy.&nbsp; This was on the sixth of September 1835.</p>
<p>Word was immediately sent to old Mr Pontifex, who received the news
with real pleasure.&nbsp; His son John&rsquo;s wife had borne daughters
only, and he was seriously uneasy lest there should be a failure in
the male line of his descendants.&nbsp; The good news, therefore, was
doubly welcome, and caused as much delight at Elmhurst as dismay in
Woburn Square, where the John Pontifexes were then living.</p>
<p>Here, indeed, this freak of fortune was felt to be all the more cruel
on account of the impossibility of resenting it openly; but the delighted
grandfather cared nothing for what the John Pontifexes might feel or
not feel; he had wanted a grandson and he had got a grandson, and this
should be enough for everybody; and, now that Mrs Theobald had taken
to good ways, she might bring him more grandsons, which would be desirable,
for he should not feel safe with fewer than three.</p>
<p>He rang the bell for the butler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gelstrap,&rdquo; he said solemnly, &ldquo;I want to go down
into the cellar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Gelstrap preceded him with a candle, and he went into the inner
vault where he kept his choicest wines.</p>
<p>He passed many bins: there was 1803 Port, 1792 Imperial Tokay, 1800
Claret, 1812 Sherry, these and many others were passed, but it was not
for them that the head of the Pontifex family had gone down into his
inner cellar.&nbsp; A bin, which had appeared empty until the full light
of the candle had been brought to bear upon it, was now found to contain
a single pint bottle.&nbsp; This was the object of Mr Pontifex&rsquo;s
search.</p>
<p>Gelstrap had often pondered over this bottle.&nbsp; It had been placed
there by Mr Pontifex himself about a dozen years previously, on his
return from a visit to his friend the celebrated traveller Dr Jones&mdash;but
there was no tablet above the bin which might give a clue to the nature
of its contents.&nbsp; On more than one occasion when his master had
gone out and left his keys accidentally behind him, as he sometimes
did, Gelstrap had submitted the bottle to all the tests he could venture
upon, but it was so carefully sealed that wisdom remained quite shut
out from that entrance at which he would have welcomed her most gladly&mdash;and
indeed from all other entrances, for he could make out nothing at all.</p>
<p>And now the mystery was to be solved.&nbsp; But alas! it seemed as
though the last chance of securing even a sip of the contents was to
be removed for ever, for Mr Pontifex took the bottle into his own hands
and held it up to the light after carefully examining the seal.&nbsp;
He smiled and left the bin with the bottle in his hands.</p>
<p>Then came a catastrophe.&nbsp; He stumbled over an empty hamper;
there was the sound of a fall&mdash;a smash of broken glass, and in
an instant the cellar floor was covered with the liquid that had been
preserved so carefully for so many years.</p>
<p>With his usual presence of mind Mr Pontifex gasped out a month&rsquo;s
warning to Gelstrap.&nbsp; Then he got up, and stamped as Theobald had
done when Christina had wanted not to order his dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s water from the Jordan,&rdquo; he exclaimed furiously,
&ldquo;which I have been saving for the baptism of my eldest grandson.&nbsp;
Damn you, Gelstrap, how dare you be so infernally careless as to leave
that hamper littering about the cellar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wonder the water of the sacred stream did not stand upright as
an heap upon the cellar floor and rebuke him.&nbsp; Gelstrap told the
other servants afterwards that his master&rsquo;s language had made
his backbone curdle.</p>
<p>The moment, however, that he heard the word &ldquo;water,&rdquo;
he saw his way again, and flew to the pantry.&nbsp; Before his master
had well noted his absence he returned with a little sponge and a basin,
and had begun sopping up the waters of the Jordan as though they had
been a common slop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll filter it, Sir,&rdquo; said Gelstrap meekly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll come quite clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Pontifex saw hope in this suggestion, which was shortly carried
out by the help of a piece of blotting paper and a funnel, under his
own eyes.&nbsp; Eventually it was found that half a pint was saved,
and this was held to be sufficient.</p>
<p>Then he made preparations for a visit to Battersby.&nbsp; He ordered
goodly hampers of the choicest eatables, he selected a goodly hamper
of choice drinkables.&nbsp; I say choice and not choicest, for although
in his first exaltation he had selected some of his very best wine,
yet on reflection he had felt that there was moderation in all things,
and as he was parting with his best water from the Jordan, he would
only send some of his second best wine.</p>
<p>Before he went to Battersby he stayed a day or two in London, which
he now seldom did, being over seventy years old, and having practically
retired from business.&nbsp; The John Pontifexes, who kept a sharp eye
on him, discovered to their dismay that he had had an interview with
his solicitors.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<p>For the first time in his life Theobald felt that he had done something
right, and could look forward to meeting his father without alarm.&nbsp;
The old gentleman, indeed, had written him a most cordial letter, announcing
his intention of standing godfather to the boy&mdash;nay, I may as well
give it in full, as it shows the writer at his best.&nbsp; It runs:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dear Theobald,&mdash;Your letter gave me very
sincere pleasure, the more so because I had made up my mind for the
worst; pray accept my most hearty congratulations for my daughter-in-law
and for yourself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have long preserved a phial of water from the Jordan for
the christening of my first grandson, should it please God to grant
me one.&nbsp; It was given me by my old friend Dr Jones.&nbsp; You will
agree with me that though the efficacy of the sacrament does not depend
upon the source of the baptismal waters, yet, <i>ceteris paribus</i>,
there is a sentiment attaching to the waters of the Jordan which should
not be despised.&nbsp; Small matters like this sometimes influence a
child&rsquo;s whole future career.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall bring my own cook, and have told him to get everything
ready for the christening dinner.&nbsp; Ask as many of your best neighbours
as your table will hold.&nbsp; By the way, I have told Lesueur <i>not
to get a lobster</i>&mdash;you had better drive over yourself and get
one from Saltness (for Battersby was only fourteen or fifteen miles
from the sea coast); they are better there, at least I think so, than
anywhere else in England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have put your boy down for something in the event of his
attaining the age of twenty-one years.&nbsp; If your brother John continues
to have nothing but girls I may do more later on, but I have many claims
upon me, and am not as well off as you may imagine.&mdash;Your affectionate
father,</p>
<p>&ldquo;G.&nbsp; PONTIFEX.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few days afterwards the writer of the above letter made his appearance
in a fly which had brought him from Gildenham to Battersby, a distance
of fourteen miles.&nbsp; There was Lesueur, the cook, on the box with
the driver, and as many hampers as the fly could carry were disposed
upon the roof and elsewhere.&nbsp; Next day the John Pontifexes had
to come, and Eliza and Maria, as well as Alethea, who, by her own special
request, was godmother to the boy, for Mr Pontifex had decided that
they were to form a happy family party; so come they all must, and be
happy they all must, or it would be the worse for them.&nbsp; Next day
the author of all this hubbub was actually christened.&nbsp; Theobald
had proposed to call him George after old Mr Pontifex, but strange to
say, Mr Pontifex over-ruled him in favour of the name Ernest.&nbsp;
The word &ldquo;earnest&rdquo; was just beginning to come into fashion,
and he thought the possession of such a name might, like his having
been baptised in water from the Jordan, have a permanent effect upon
the boy&rsquo;s character, and influence him for good during the more
critical periods of his life.</p>
<p>I was asked to be his second godfather, and was rejoiced to have
an opportunity of meeting Alethea, whom I had not seen for some few
years, but with whom I had been in constant correspondence.&nbsp; She
and I had always been friends from the time we had played together as
children onwards.&nbsp; When the death of her grandfather and grandmother
severed her connection with Paleham my intimacy with the Pontifexes
was kept up by my having been at school and college with Theobald, and
each time I saw her I admired her more and more as the best, kindest,
wittiest, most lovable, and, to my mind, handsomest woman whom I had
ever seen.&nbsp; None of the Pontifexes were deficient in good looks;
they were a well-grown shapely family enough, but Alethea was the flower
of the flock even as regards good looks, while in respect of all other
qualities that make a woman lovable, it seemed as though the stock that
had been intended for the three daughters, and would have been about
sufficient for them, had all been allotted to herself, her sisters getting
none, and she all.</p>
<p>It is impossible for me to explain how it was that she and I never
married.&nbsp; We two knew exceedingly well, and that must suffice for
the reader.&nbsp; There was the most perfect sympathy and understanding
between us; we knew that neither of us would marry anyone else.&nbsp;
I had asked her to marry me a dozen times over; having said this much
I will say no more upon a point which is in no way necessary for the
development of my story.&nbsp; For the last few years there had been
difficulties in the way of our meeting, and I had not seen her, though,
as I have said, keeping up a close correspondence with her.&nbsp; Naturally
I was overjoyed to meet her again; she was now just thirty years old,
but I thought she looked handsomer than ever.</p>
<p>Her father, of course, was the lion of the party, but seeing that
we were all meek and quite willing to be eaten, he roared to us rather
than at us.&nbsp; It was a fine sight to see him tucking his napkin
under his rosy old gills, and letting it fall over his capacious waistcoat
while the high light from the chandelier danced about the bump of benevolence
on his bald old head like a star of Bethlehem.</p>
<p>The soup was real turtle; the old gentleman was evidently well pleased
and he was beginning to come out.&nbsp; Gelstrap stood behind his master&rsquo;s
chair.&nbsp; I sat next Mrs Theobald on her left hand, and was thus
just opposite her father-in-law, whom I had every opportunity of observing.</p>
<p>During the first ten minutes or so, which were taken up with the
soup and the bringing in of the fish, I should probably have thought,
if I had not long since made up my mind about him, what a fine old man
he was and how proud his children should be of him; but suddenly as
he was helping himself to lobster sauce, he flushed crimson, a look
of extreme vexation suffused his face, and he darted two furtive but
fiery glances to the two ends of the table, one for Theobald and one
for Christina.&nbsp; They, poor simple souls, of course saw that something
was exceedingly wrong, and so did I, but I couldn&rsquo;t guess what
it was till I heard the old man hiss in Christina&rsquo;s ear: &ldquo;It
was not made with a hen lobster.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the use,&rdquo;
he continued, &ldquo;of my calling the boy Ernest, and getting him christened
in water from the Jordan, if his own father does not know a cock from
a hen lobster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This cut me too, for I felt that till that moment I had not so much
as known that there were cocks and hens among lobsters, but had vaguely
thought that in the matter of matrimony they were even as the angels
in heaven, and grew up almost spontaneously from rocks and sea-weed.</p>
<p>Before the next course was over Mr Pontifex had recovered his temper,
and from that time to the end of the evening he was at his best.&nbsp;
He told us all about the water from the Jordan; how it had been brought
by Dr Jones along with some stone jars of water from the Rhine, the
Rhone, the Elbe and the Danube, and what trouble he had had with them
at the Custom Houses, and how the intention had been to make punch with
waters from all the greatest rivers in Europe; and how he, Mr Pontifex,
had saved the Jordan water from going into the bowl, etc., etc.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;it wouldn&rsquo;t have
done at all, you know; very profane idea; so we each took a pint bottle
of it home with us, and the punch was much better without it.&nbsp;
I had a narrow escape with mine, though, the other day; I fell over
a hamper in the cellar, when I was getting it up to bring to Battersby,
and if I had not taken the greatest care the bottle would certainly
have been broken, but I saved it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Gelstrap was standing
behind his chair all the time!</p>
<p>Nothing more happened to ruffle Mr Pontifex, so we had a delightful
evening, which has often recurred to me while watching the after career
of my godson.</p>
<p>I called a day or two afterwards and found Mr Pontifex still at Battersby,
laid up with one of those attacks of liver and depression to which he
was becoming more and more subject.&nbsp; I stayed to luncheon.&nbsp;
The old gentleman was cross and very difficult; he could eat nothing&mdash;had
no appetite at all.&nbsp; Christina tried to coax him with a little
bit of the fleshy part of a mutton chop.&nbsp; &ldquo;How in the name
of reason can I be asked to eat a mutton chop?&rdquo; he exclaimed angrily;
&ldquo;you forget, my dear Christina, that you have to deal with a stomach
that is totally disorganised,&rdquo; and he pushed the plate from him,
pouting and frowning like a naughty old child.&nbsp; Writing as I do
by the light of a later knowledge, I suppose I should have seen nothing
in this but the world&rsquo;s growing pains, the disturbance inseparable
from transition in human things.&nbsp; I suppose in reality not a leaf
goes yellow in autumn without ceasing to care about its sap and making
the parent tree very uncomfortable by long growling and grumbling&mdash;but
surely nature might find some less irritating way of carrying on business
if she would give her mind to it.&nbsp; Why should the generations overlap
one another at all?&nbsp; Why cannot we be buried as eggs in neat little
cells with ten or twenty thousand pounds each wrapped round us in Bank
of England notes, and wake up, as the sphex wasp does, to find that
its papa and mamma have not only left ample provision at its elbow,
but have been eaten by sparrows some weeks before it began to live consciously
on its own account?</p>
<p>About a year and a half afterwards the tables were turned on Battersby&mdash;for
Mrs John Pontifex was safely delivered of a boy.&nbsp; A year or so
later still, George Pontifex was himself struck down suddenly by a fit
of paralysis, much as his mother had been, but he did not see the years
of his mother.&nbsp; When his will was opened, it was found that an
original bequest of &pound;20,000 to Theobald himself (over and above
the sum that had been settled upon him and Christina at the time of
his marriage) had been cut down to &pound;17,500 when Mr Pontifex left
&ldquo;something&rdquo; to Ernest.&nbsp; The &ldquo;something&rdquo;
proved to be &pound;2500, which was to accumulate in the hands of trustees.&nbsp;
The rest of the property went to John Pontifex, except that each of
the daughters was left with about &pound;15,000 over and above &pound;5000
a piece which they inherited from their mother.</p>
<p>Theobald&rsquo;s father then had told him the truth but not the whole
truth.&nbsp; Nevertheless, what right had Theobald to complain?&nbsp;
Certainly it was rather hard to make him think that he and his were
to be gainers, and get the honour and glory of the bequest, when all
the time the money was virtually being taken out of Theobald&rsquo;s
own pocket.&nbsp; On the other hand the father doubtless argued that
he had never told Theobald he was to have anything at all; he had a
full right to do what he liked with his own money; if Theobald chose
to indulge in unwarrantable expectations that was no affair of his;
as it was he was providing for him liberally; and if he did take &pound;2500
of Theobald&rsquo;s share he was still leaving it to Theobald&rsquo;s
son, which, of course, was much the same thing in the end.</p>
<p>No one can deny that the testator had strict right upon his side;
nevertheless the reader will agree with me that Theobald and Christina
might not have considered the christening dinner so great a success
if all the facts had been before them.&nbsp; Mr Pontifex had during
his own lifetime set up a monument in Elmhurst Church to the memory
of his wife (a slab with urns and cherubs like illegitimate children
of King George the Fourth, and all the rest of it), and had left space
for his own epitaph underneath that of his wife.&nbsp; I do not know
whether it was written by one of his children, or whether they got some
friend to write it for them.&nbsp; I do not believe that any satire
was intended.&nbsp; I believe that it was the intention to convey that
nothing short of the Day of Judgement could give anyone an idea how
good a man Mr Pontifex had been, but at first I found it hard to think
that it was free from guile.</p>
<p>The epitaph begins by giving dates of birth and death; then sets
out that the deceased was for many years head of the firm of Fairlie
and Pontifex, and also resident in the parish of Elmhurst.&nbsp; There
is not a syllable of either praise or dispraise.&nbsp; The last lines
run as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>HE NOW LIES AWAITING A JOYFUL RESURRECTION<br />
AT THE LAST DAY.<br />
WHAT MANNER OF MAN HE WAS<br />
THAT DAY WILL DISCOVER.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<p>This much, however, we may say in the meantime, that having lived
to be nearly seventy-three years old and died rich he must have been
in very fair harmony with his surroundings.&nbsp; I have heard it said
sometimes that such and such a person&rsquo;s life was a lie: but no
man&rsquo;s life can be a very bad lie; as long as it continues at all
it is at worst nine-tenths of it true.</p>
<p>Mr Pontifex&rsquo;s life not only continued a long time, but was
prosperous right up to the end.&nbsp; Is not this enough?&nbsp; Being
in this world is it not our most obvious business to make the most of
it&mdash;to observe what things do <i>bona fide</i> tend to long life
and comfort, and to act accordingly?&nbsp; All animals, except man,
know that the principal business of life is to enjoy it&mdash;and they
do enjoy it as much as man and other circumstances will allow.&nbsp;
He has spent his life best who has enjoyed it most; God will take care
that we do not enjoy it any more than is good for us.&nbsp; If Mr Pontifex
is to be blamed it is for not having eaten and drunk less and thus suffered
less from his liver, and lived perhaps a year or two longer.</p>
<p>Goodness is naught unless it tends towards old age and sufficiency
of means.&nbsp; I speak broadly and <i>exceptis excipiendis</i>.&nbsp;
So the psalmist says, &ldquo;The righteous shall not lack anything that
is good.&rdquo;&nbsp; Either this is mere poetical license, or it follows
that he who lacks anything that is good is not righteous; there is a
presumption also that he who has passed a long life without lacking
anything that is good has himself also been good enough for practical
purposes.</p>
<p>Mr Pontifex never lacked anything he much cared about.&nbsp; True,
he might have been happier than he was if he had cared about things
which he did not care for, but the gist of this lies in the &ldquo;if
he had cared.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have all sinned and come short of the
glory of making ourselves as comfortable as we easily might have done,
but in this particular case Mr Pontifex did not care, and would not
have gained much by getting what he did not want.</p>
<p>There is no casting of swine&rsquo;s meat before men worse than that
which would flatter virtue as though her true origin were not good enough
for her, but she must have a lineage, deduced as it were by spiritual
heralds, from some stock with which she has nothing to do.&nbsp; Virtue&rsquo;s
true lineage is older and more respectable than any that can be invented
for her.&nbsp; She springs from man&rsquo;s experience concerning his
own well-being&mdash;and this, though not infallible, is still the least
fallible thing we have.&nbsp; A system which cannot stand without a
better foundation than this must have something so unstable within itself
that it will topple over on whatever pedestal we place it.</p>
<p>The world has long ago settled that morality and virtue are what
bring men peace at the last.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be virtuous,&rdquo; says the
copy-book, &ldquo;and you will be happy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely if a reputed
virtue fails often in this respect it is only an insidious form of vice,
and if a reputed vice brings no very serious mischief on a man&rsquo;s
later years it is not so bad a vice as it is said to be.&nbsp; Unfortunately
though we are all of a mind about the main opinion that virtue is what
tends to happiness, and vice what ends in sorrow, we are not so unanimous
about details&mdash;that is to say as to whether any given course, such,
we will say, as smoking, has a tendency to happiness or the reverse.</p>
<p>I submit it as the result of my own poor observation, that a good
deal of unkindness and selfishness on the part of parents towards children
is not generally followed by ill consequences to the parents themselves.&nbsp;
They may cast a gloom over their children&rsquo;s lives for many years
without having to suffer anything that will hurt them.&nbsp; I should
say, then, that it shows no great moral obliquity on the part of parents
if within certain limits they make their children&rsquo;s lives a burden
to them.</p>
<p>Granted that Mr Pontifex&rsquo;s was not a very exalted character,
ordinary men are not required to have very exalted characters.&nbsp;
It is enough if we are of the same moral and mental stature as the &ldquo;main&rdquo;
or &ldquo;mean&rdquo; part of men&mdash;that is to say as the average.</p>
<p>It is involved in the very essence of things that rich men who die
old shall have been mean.&nbsp; The greatest and wisest of mankind will
be almost always found to be the meanest&mdash;the ones who have kept
the &ldquo;mean&rdquo; best between excess either of virtue or vice.&nbsp;
They hardly ever have been prosperous if they have not done this, and,
considering how many miscarry altogether, it is no small feather in
a man&rsquo;s cap if he has been no worse than his neighbours.&nbsp;
Homer tells us about some one who made it his business &alpha;&iota;&epsilon;&nu;
&alpha;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&epsilon;&upsilon;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;
&kappa;&alpha;&iota; &upsilon;&pi;&epsilon;&iota;&rho;&omicron;&chi;&omicron;&nu;
&epsilon;&mu;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&alpha;&iota; &alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&omega;&nu;&mdash;always
to excel and to stand higher than other people.&nbsp; What an uncompanionable
disagreeable person he must have been!&nbsp; Homer&rsquo;s heroes generally
came to a bad end, and I doubt not that this gentleman, whoever he was,
did so sooner or later.</p>
<p>A very high standard, again, involves the possession of rare virtues,
and rare virtues are like rare plants or animals, things that have not
been able to hold their own in the world.&nbsp; A virtue to be serviceable
must, like gold, be alloyed with some commoner but more durable metal.</p>
<p>People divide off vice and virtue as though they were two things,
neither of which had with it anything of the other.&nbsp; This is not
so.&nbsp; There is no useful virtue which has not some alloy of vice,
and hardly any vice, if any, which carries not with it a little dash
of virtue; virtue and vice are like life and death, or mind and matter&mdash;things
which cannot exist without being qualified by their opposite.&nbsp;
The most absolute life contains death, and the corpse is still in many
respects living; so also it has been said, &ldquo;If thou, Lord, wilt
be extreme to mark what is done amiss,&rdquo; which shows that even
the highest ideal we can conceive will yet admit so much compromise
with vice as shall countenance the poor abuses of the time, if they
are not too outrageous.&nbsp; That vice pays homage to virtue is notorious;
we call this hypocrisy; there should be a word found for the homage
which virtue not unfrequently pays, or at any rate would be wise in
paying, to vice.</p>
<p>I grant that some men will find happiness in having what we all feel
to be a higher moral standard than others.&nbsp; If they go in for this,
however, they must be content with virtue as her own reward, and not
grumble if they find lofty Quixotism an expensive luxury, whose rewards
belong to a kingdom that is not of this world.&nbsp; They must not wonder
if they cut a poor figure in trying to make the most of both worlds.&nbsp;
Disbelieve as we may the details of the accounts which record the growth
of the Christian religion, yet a great part of Christian teaching will
remain as true as though we accepted the details.&nbsp; We cannot serve
God and Mammon; strait is the way and narrow is the gate which leads
to what those who live by faith hold to be best worth having, and there
is no way of saying this better than the Bible has done.&nbsp; It is
well there should be some who think thus, as it is well there should
be speculators in commerce, who will often burn their fingers&mdash;but
it is not well that the majority should leave the &ldquo;mean&rdquo;
and beaten path.</p>
<p>For most men, and most circumstances, pleasure&mdash;tangible material
prosperity in this world&mdash;is the safest test of virtue.&nbsp; Progress
has ever been through the pleasures rather than through the extreme
sharp virtues, and the most virtuous have leaned to excess rather than
to asceticism.&nbsp; To use a commercial metaphor, competition is so
keen, and the margin of profits has been cut down so closely that virtue
cannot afford to throw any <i>bona fide</i> chance away, and must base
her action rather on the actual moneying out of conduct than on a flattering
prospectus.&nbsp; She will not therefore neglect&mdash;as some do who
are prudent and economical enough in other matters&mdash;the important
factor of our chance of escaping detection, or at any rate of our dying
first.&nbsp; A reasonable virtue will give this chance its due value,
neither more nor less.</p>
<p>Pleasure, after all, is a safer guide than either right or duty.&nbsp;
For hard as it is to know what gives us pleasure, right and duty are
often still harder to distinguish and, if we go wrong with them, will
lead us into just as sorry a plight as a mistaken opinion concerning
pleasure.&nbsp; When men burn their fingers through following after
pleasure they find out their mistake and get to see where they have
gone wrong more easily than when they have burnt them through following
after a fancied duty, or a fancied idea concerning right virtue.&nbsp;
The devil, in fact, when he dresses himself in angel&rsquo;s clothes,
can only be detected by experts of exceptional skill, and so often does
he adopt this disguise that it is hardly safe to be seen talking to
an angel at all, and prudent people will follow after pleasure as a
more homely but more respectable and on the whole much more trustworthy
guide.</p>
<p>Returning to Mr Pontifex, over and above his having lived long and
prosperously, he left numerous offspring, to all of whom he communicated
not only his physical and mental characteristics, with no more than
the usual amount of modification, but also no small share of characteristics
which are less easily transmitted&mdash;I mean his pecuniary characteristics.&nbsp;
It may be said that he acquired these by sitting still and letting money
run, as it were, right up against him, but against how many does not
money run who do not take it when it does, or who, even if they hold
it for a little while, cannot so incorporate it with themselves that
it shall descend through them to their offspring?&nbsp; Mr Pontifex
did this.&nbsp; He kept what he may be said to have made, and money
is like a reputation for ability&mdash;more easily made than kept.</p>
<p>Take him, then, for all in all, I am not inclined to be so severe
upon him as my father was.&nbsp; Judge him according to any very lofty
standard, and he is nowhere.&nbsp; Judge him according to a fair average
standard, and there is not much fault to be found with him.&nbsp; I
have said what I have said in the foregoing chapter once for all, and
shall not break my thread to repeat it.&nbsp; It should go without saying
in modification of the verdict which the reader may be inclined to pass
too hastily, not only upon Mr George Pontifex, but also upon Theobald
and Christina.&nbsp; And now I will continue my story.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<p>The birth of his son opened Theobald&rsquo;s eyes to a good deal
which he had but faintly realised hitherto.&nbsp; He had had no idea
how great a nuisance a baby was.&nbsp; Babies come into the world so
suddenly at the end, and upset everything so terribly when they do come:
why cannot they steal in upon us with less of a shock to the domestic
system?&nbsp; His wife, too, did not recover rapidly from her confinement;
she remained an invalid for months; here was another nuisance and an
expensive one, which interfered with the amount which Theobald liked
to put by out of his income against, as he said, a rainy day, or to
make provision for his family if he should have one.&nbsp; Now he was
getting a family, so that it became all the more necessary to put money
by, and here was the baby hindering him.&nbsp; Theorists may say what
they like about a man&rsquo;s children being a continuation of his own
identity, but it will generally be found that those who talk in this
way have no children of their own.&nbsp; Practical family men know better.</p>
<p>About twelve months after the birth of Ernest there came a second,
also a boy, who was christened Joseph, and in less than twelve months
afterwards, a girl, to whom was given the name of Charlotte.&nbsp; A
few months before this girl was born Christina paid a visit to the John
Pontifexes in London, and, knowing her condition, passed a good deal
of time at the Royal Academy exhibition looking at the types of female
beauty portrayed by the Academicians, for she had made up her mind that
the child this time was to be a girl.&nbsp; Alethea warned her not to
do this, but she persisted, and certainly the child turned out plain,
but whether the pictures caused this or no I cannot say.</p>
<p>Theobald had never liked children.&nbsp; He had always got away from
them as soon as he could, and so had they from him; oh, why, he was
inclined to ask himself, could not children be born into the world grown
up?&nbsp; If Christina could have given birth to a few full-grown clergymen
in priest&rsquo;s orders&mdash;of moderate views, but inclining rather
to Evangelicalism, with comfortable livings and in all respects facsimiles
of Theobald himself&mdash;why, there might have been more sense in it;
or if people could buy ready-made children at a shop of whatever age
and sex they liked, instead of always having to make them at home and
to begin at the beginning with them&mdash;that might do better, but
as it was he did not like it.&nbsp; He felt as he had felt when he had
been required to come and be married to Christina&mdash;that he had
been going on for a long time quite nicely, and would much rather continue
things on their present footing.&nbsp; In the matter of getting married
he had been obliged to pretend he liked it; but times were changed,
and if he did not like a thing now, he could find a hundred unexceptionable
ways of making his dislike apparent.</p>
<p>It might have been better if Theobald in his younger days had kicked
more against his father: the fact that he had not done so encouraged
him to expect the most implicit obedience from his own children.&nbsp;
He could trust himself, he said (and so did Christina), to be more lenient
than perhaps his father had been to himself; his danger, he said (and
so again did Christina), would be rather in the direction of being too
indulgent; he must be on his guard against this, for no duty could be
more important than that of teaching a child to obey its parents in
all things.</p>
<p>He had read not long since of an Eastern traveller, who, while exploring
somewhere in the more remote parts of Arabia and Asia Minor, had come
upon a remarkably hardy, sober, industrious little Christian community&mdash;all
of them in the best of health&mdash;who had turned out to be the actual
living descendants of Jonadab, the son of Rechab; and two men in European
costume, indeed, but speaking English with a broken accent, and by their
colour evidently Oriental, had come begging to Battersby soon afterwards,
and represented themselves as belonging to this people; they had said
they were collecting funds to promote the conversion of their fellow
tribesmen to the English branch of the Christian religion.&nbsp; True,
they turned out to be impostors, for when he gave them a pound and Christina
five shillings from her private purse, they went and got drunk with
it in the next village but one to Battersby; still, this did not invalidate
the story of the Eastern traveller.&nbsp; Then there were the Romans&mdash;whose
greatness was probably due to the wholesome authority exercised by the
head of a family over all its members.&nbsp; Some Romans had even killed
their children; this was going too far, but then the Romans were not
Christians, and knew no better.</p>
<p>The practical outcome of the foregoing was a conviction in Theobald&rsquo;s
mind, and if in his, then in Christina&rsquo;s, that it was their duty
to begin training up their children in the way they should go, even
from their earliest infancy.&nbsp; The first signs of self-will must
be carefully looked for, and plucked up by the roots at once before
they had time to grow.&nbsp; Theobald picked up this numb serpent of
a metaphor and cherished it in his bosom.</p>
<p>Before Ernest could well crawl he was taught to kneel; before he
could well speak he was taught to lisp the Lord&rsquo;s prayer, and
the general confession.&nbsp; How was it possible that these things
could be taught too early?&nbsp; If his attention flagged or his memory
failed him, here was an ill weed which would grow apace, unless it were
plucked out immediately, and the only way to pluck it out was to whip
him, or shut him up in a cupboard, or dock him of some of the small
pleasures of childhood.&nbsp; Before he was three years old he could
read and, after a fashion, write.&nbsp; Before he was four he was learning
Latin, and could do rule of three sums.</p>
<p>As for the child himself, he was naturally of an even temper, he
doted upon his nurse, on kittens and puppies, and on all things that
would do him the kindness of allowing him to be fond of them.&nbsp;
He was fond of his mother, too, but as regards his father, he has told
me in later life he could remember no feeling but fear and shrinking.&nbsp;
Christina did not remonstrate with Theobald concerning the severity
of the tasks imposed upon their boy, nor yet as to the continual whippings
that were found necessary at lesson times.&nbsp; Indeed, when during
any absence of Theobald&rsquo;s the lessons were entrusted to her, she
found to her sorrow that it was the only thing to do, and she did it
no less effectually than Theobald himself, nevertheless she was fond
of her boy, which Theobald never was, and it was long before she could
destroy all affection for herself in the mind of her first-born.&nbsp;
But she persevered.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<p>Strange! for she believed she doted upon him, and certainly she loved
him better than either of her other children.&nbsp; Her version of the
matter was that there had never yet been two parents so self-denying
and devoted to the highest welfare of their children as Theobald and
herself.&nbsp; For Ernest, a very great future&mdash;she was certain
of it&mdash;was in store.&nbsp; This made severity all the more necessary,
so that from the first he might have been kept pure from every taint
of evil.&nbsp; She could not allow herself the scope for castle building
which, we read, was indulged in by every Jewish matron before the appearance
of the Messiah, for the Messiah had now come, but there was to be a
millennium shortly, certainly not later than 1866, when Ernest would
be just about the right age for it, and a modern Elias would be wanted
to herald its approach.&nbsp; Heaven would bear her witness that she
had never shrunk from the idea of martyrdom for herself and Theobald,
nor would she avoid it for her boy, if his life was required of her
in her Redeemer&rsquo;s service.&nbsp; Oh, no!&nbsp; If God told her
to offer up her first-born, as He had told Abraham, she would take him
up to Pigbury Beacon and plunge the&mdash;no, that she could not do,
but it would be unnecessary&mdash;some one else might do that.&nbsp;
It was not for nothing that Ernest had been baptised in water from the
Jordan.&nbsp; It had not been her doing, nor yet Theobald&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
They had not sought it.&nbsp; When water from the sacred stream was
wanted for a sacred infant, the channel had been found through which
it was to flow from far Palestine over land and sea to the door of the
house where the child was lying.&nbsp; Why, it was a miracle!&nbsp;
It was!&nbsp; It was!&nbsp; She saw it all now.&nbsp; The Jordan had
left its bed and flowed into her own house.&nbsp; It was idle to say
that this was not a miracle.&nbsp; No miracle was effected without means
of some kind; the difference between the faithful and the unbeliever
consisted in the very fact that the former could see a miracle where
the latter could not.&nbsp; The Jews could see no miracle even in the
raising of Lazarus and the feeding of the five thousand.&nbsp; The John
Pontifexes would see no miracle in this matter of the water from the
Jordan.&nbsp; The essence of a miracle lay not in the fact that means
had been dispensed with, but in the adoption of means to a great end
that had not been available without interference; and no one would suppose
that Dr Jones would have brought the water unless he had been directed.&nbsp;
She would tell this to Theobald, and get him to see it in the . . .
and yet perhaps it would be better not.&nbsp; The insight of women upon
matters of this sort was deeper and more unerring than that of men.&nbsp;
It was a woman and not a man who had been filled most completely with
the whole fulness of the Deity.&nbsp; But why had they not treasured
up the water after it was used?&nbsp; It ought never, never to have
been thrown away, but it had been.&nbsp; Perhaps, however, this was
for the best too&mdash;they might have been tempted to set too much
store by it, and it might have become a source of spiritual danger to
them&mdash;perhaps even of spiritual pride, the very sin of all others
which she most abhorred.&nbsp; As for the channel through which the
Jordan had flowed to Battersby, that mattered not more than the earth
through which the river ran in Palestine itself.&nbsp; Dr Jones was
certainly worldly&mdash;very worldly; so, she regretted to feel, had
been her father-in-law, though in a less degree; spiritual, at heart,
doubtless, and becoming more and more spiritual continually as he grew
older, still he was tainted with the world, till a very few hours, probably,
before his death, whereas she and Theobald had given up all for Christ&rsquo;s
sake.&nbsp; <i>They</i> were not worldly.&nbsp; At least Theobald was
not.&nbsp; She had been, but she was sure she had grown in grace since
she had left off eating things strangled and blood&mdash;this was as
the washing in Jordan as against Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus.&nbsp;
Her boy should never touch a strangled fowl nor a black pudding&mdash;that,
at any rate, she could see to.&nbsp; He should have a coral from the
neighbourhood of Joppa&mdash;there were coral insects on those coasts,
so that the thing could easily be done with a little energy; she would
write to Dr Jones about it, etc.&nbsp; And so on for hours together
day after day for years.&nbsp; Truly, Mrs Theobald loved her child according
to her lights with an exceeding great fondness, but the dreams she had
dreamed in sleep were sober realities in comparison with those she indulged
in while awake.</p>
<p>When Ernest was in his second year, Theobald, as I have already said,
began to teach him to read.&nbsp; He began to whip him two days after
he had begun to teach him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was painful,&rdquo; as he said to Christina, but it was
the only thing to do and it was done.&nbsp; The child was puny, white
and sickly, so they sent continually for the doctor who dosed him with
calomel and James&rsquo;s powder.&nbsp; All was done in love, anxiety,
timidity, stupidity, and impatience.&nbsp; They were stupid in little
things; and he that is stupid in little will be stupid also in much.</p>
<p>Presently old Mr Pontifex died, and then came the revelation of the
little alteration he had made in his will simultaneously with his bequest
to Ernest.&nbsp; It was rather hard to bear, especially as there was
no way of conveying a bit of their minds to the testator now that he
could no longer hurt them.&nbsp; As regards the boy himself anyone must
see that the bequest would be an unmitigated misfortune to him.&nbsp;
To leave him a small independence was perhaps the greatest injury which
one could inflict upon a young man.&nbsp; It would cripple his energies,
and deaden his desire for active employment.&nbsp; Many a youth was
led into evil courses by the knowledge that on arriving at majority
he would come into a few thousands.&nbsp; They might surely have been
trusted to have their boy&rsquo;s interests at heart, and must be better
judges of those interests than he, at twenty-one, could be expected
to be: besides if Jonadab, the son of Rechab&rsquo;s father&mdash;or
perhaps it might be simpler under the circumstances to say Rechab at
once&mdash;if Rechab, then, had left handsome legacies to his grandchildren&mdash;why
Jonadab might not have found those children so easy to deal with, etc.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Theobald, after having discussed the matter
with Christina for the twentieth time, &ldquo;my dear, the only thing
to guide and console us under misfortunes of this kind is to take refuge
in practical work.&nbsp; I will go and pay a visit to Mrs Thompson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On those days Mrs Thompson would be told that her sins were all washed
white, etc., a little sooner and a little more peremptorily than on
others.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<p>I used to stay at Battersby for a day or two sometimes, while my
godson and his brother and sister were children.&nbsp; I hardly know
why I went, for Theobald and I grew more and more apart, but one gets
into grooves sometimes, and the supposed friendship between myself and
the Pontifexes continued to exist, though it was now little more than
rudimentary.&nbsp; My godson pleased me more than either of the other
children, but he had not much of the buoyancy of childhood, and was
more like a puny, sallow little old man than I liked.&nbsp; The young
people, however, were very ready to be friendly.</p>
<p>I remember Ernest and his brother hovered round me on the first day
of one of these visits with their hands full of fading flowers, which
they at length proffered me.&nbsp; On this I did what I suppose was
expected: I inquired if there was a shop near where they could buy sweeties.&nbsp;
They said there was, so I felt in my pockets, but only succeeded in
finding two pence halfpenny in small money.&nbsp; This I gave them,
and the youngsters, aged four and three, toddled off alone.&nbsp; Ere
long they returned, and Ernest said, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get sweeties
for all this money&rdquo; (I felt rebuked, but no rebuke was intended);
&ldquo;we can get sweeties for this&rdquo; (showing a penny), &ldquo;and
for this&rdquo; (showing another penny), &ldquo;but we cannot get them
for all this,&rdquo; and he added the halfpenny to the two pence.&nbsp;
I suppose they had wanted a twopenny cake, or something like that.&nbsp;
I was amused, and left them to solve the difficulty their own way, being
anxious to see what they would do.</p>
<p>Presently Ernest said, &ldquo;May we give you back this&rdquo; (showing
the halfpenny) &ldquo;and not give you back this and this?&rdquo; (showing
the pence).&nbsp; I assented, and they gave a sigh of relief and went
on their way rejoicing.&nbsp; A few more presents of pence and small
toys completed the conquest, and they began to take me into their confidence.</p>
<p>They told me a good deal which I am afraid I ought not to have listened
to.&nbsp; They said that if grandpapa had lived longer he would most
likely have been made a Lord, and that then papa would have been the
Honourable and Reverend, but that grandpapa was now in heaven singing
beautiful hymns with grandmamma Allaby to Jesus Christ, who was very
fond of them; and that when Ernest was ill, his mamma had told him he
need not be afraid of dying for he would go straight to heaven, if he
would only be sorry for having done his lessons so badly and vexed his
dear papa, and if he would promise never, never to vex him any more;
and that when he got to heaven grandpapa and grandmamma Allaby would
meet him, and he would be always with them, and they would be very good
to him and teach him to sing ever such beautiful hymns, more beautiful
by far than those which he was now so fond of, etc., etc.; but he did
not wish to die, and was glad when he got better, for there were no
kittens in heaven, and he did not think there were cowslips to make
cowslip tea with.</p>
<p>Their mother was plainly disappointed in them.&nbsp; &ldquo;My children
are none of them geniuses, Mr Overton,&rdquo; she said to me at breakfast
one morning.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have fair abilities, and, thanks to Theobald&rsquo;s
tuition, they are forward for their years, but they have nothing like
genius: genius is a thing apart from this, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course I said it was &ldquo;a thing quite apart from this,&rdquo;
but if my thoughts had been laid bare, they would have appeared as &ldquo;Give
me my coffee immediately, ma&rsquo;am, and don&rsquo;t talk nonsense.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I have no idea what genius is, but so far as I can form any conception
about it, I should say it was a stupid word which cannot be too soon
abandoned to scientific and literary <i>claqueurs</i>.</p>
<p>I do not know exactly what Christina expected, but I should imagine
it was something like this: &ldquo;My children ought to be all geniuses,
because they are mine and Theobald&rsquo;s, and it is naughty of them
not to be; but, of course, they cannot be so good and clever as Theobald
and I were, and if they show signs of being so it will be naughty of
them.&nbsp; Happily, however, they are not this, and yet it is very
dreadful that they are not.&nbsp; As for genius&mdash;hoity-toity, indeed&mdash;why,
a genius should turn intellectual summersaults as soon as it is born,
and none of my children have yet been able to get into the newspapers.&nbsp;
I will not have children of mine give themselves airs&mdash;it is enough
for them that Theobald and I should do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not know, poor woman, that the true greatness wears an invisible
cloak, under cover of which it goes in and out among men without being
suspected; if its cloak does not conceal it from itself always, and
from all others for many years, its greatness will ere long shrink to
very ordinary dimensions.&nbsp; What, then, it may be asked, is the
good of being great?&nbsp; The answer is that you may understand greatness
better in others, whether alive or dead, and choose better company from
these and enjoy and understand that company better when you have chosen
it&mdash;also that you may be able to give pleasure to the best people
and live in the lives of those who are yet unborn.&nbsp; This, one would
think, was substantial gain enough for greatness without its wanting
to ride rough-shod over us, even when disguised as humility.</p>
<p>I was there on a Sunday, and observed the rigour with which the young
people were taught to observe the Sabbath; they might not cut out things,
nor use their paintbox on a Sunday, and this they thought rather hard,
because their cousins the John Pontifexes might do these things.&nbsp;
Their cousins might play with their toy train on Sunday, but though
they had promised that they would run none but Sunday trains, all traffic
had been prohibited.&nbsp; One treat only was allowed them&mdash;on
Sunday evenings they might choose their own hymns.</p>
<p>In the course of the evening they came into the drawing-room, and,
as an especial treat, were to sing some of their hymns to me, instead
of saying them, so that I might hear how nicely they sang.&nbsp; Ernest
was to choose the first hymn, and he chose one about some people who
were to come to the sunset tree.&nbsp; I am no botanist, and do not
know what kind of tree a sunset tree is, but the words began, &ldquo;Come,
come, come; come to the sunset tree for the day is past and gone.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The tune was rather pretty and had taken Ernest&rsquo;s fancy, for he
was unusually fond of music and had a sweet little child&rsquo;s voice
which he liked using.</p>
<p>He was, however, very late in being able to sound a hard it &ldquo;c&rdquo;
or &ldquo;k,&rdquo; and, instead of saying &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said
&ldquo;Tum tum, tum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ernest,&rdquo; said Theobald, from the arm-chair in front
of the fire, where he was sitting with his hands folded before him,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think it would be very nice if you were to say
&lsquo;come&rsquo; like other people, instead of &lsquo;tum&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do say tum,&rdquo; replied Ernest, meaning that he had said
&ldquo;come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Theobald was always in a bad temper on Sunday evening.&nbsp; Whether
it is that they are as much bored with the day as their neighbours,
or whether they are tired, or whatever the cause may be, clergymen are
seldom at their best on Sunday evening; I had already seen signs that
evening that my host was cross, and was a little nervous at hearing
Ernest say so promptly &ldquo;I do say tum,&rdquo; when his papa had
said he did not say it as he should.</p>
<p>Theobald noticed the fact that he was being contradicted in a moment.&nbsp;
He got up from his arm-chair and went to the piano.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Ernest, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you say
nothing of the kind, you say &lsquo;tum,&rsquo; not &lsquo;come.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Now say &lsquo;come&rsquo; after me, as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tum,&rdquo; said Ernest, at once; &ldquo;is that better?&rdquo;&nbsp;
I have no doubt he thought it was, but it was not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Ernest, you are not taking pains: you are not trying
as you ought to do.&nbsp; It is high time you learned to say &lsquo;come,&rsquo;
why, Joey can say &lsquo;come,&rsquo; can&rsquo;t you, Joey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeth, I can,&rdquo; replied Joey, and he said something which
was not far off &ldquo;come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, Ernest, do you hear that?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no difficulty
about it, nor shadow of difficulty.&nbsp; Now, take your own time, think
about it, and say &lsquo;come&rsquo; after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy remained silent a few seconds and then said &ldquo;tum&rdquo;
again.</p>
<p>I laughed, but Theobald turned to me impatiently and said, &ldquo;Please
do not laugh, Overton; it will make the boy think it does not matter,
and it matters a great deal;&rdquo; then turning to Ernest he said,
&ldquo;Now, Ernest, I will give you one more chance, and if you don&rsquo;t
say &lsquo;come,&rsquo; I shall know that you are self-willed and naughty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked very angry, and a shade came over Ernest&rsquo;s face,
like that which comes upon the face of a puppy when it is being scolded
without understanding why.&nbsp; The child saw well what was coming
now, was frightened, and, of course, said &ldquo;tum&rdquo; once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Ernest,&rdquo; said his father, catching him angrily
by the shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have done my best to save you, but if
you will have it so, you will,&rdquo; and he lugged the little wretch,
crying by anticipation, out of the room.&nbsp; A few minutes more and
we could hear screams coming from the dining-room, across the hall which
separated the drawing-room from the dining-room, and knew that poor
Ernest was being beaten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have sent him up to bed,&rdquo; said Theobald, as he returned
to the drawing-room, &ldquo;and now, Christina, I think we will have
the servants in to prayers,&rdquo; and he rang the bell for them, red-handed
as he was.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<p>The man-servant William came and set the chairs for the maids, and
presently they filed in.&nbsp; First Christina&rsquo;s maid, then the
cook, then the housemaid, then William, and then the coachman.&nbsp;
I sat opposite them, and watched their faces as Theobald read a chapter
from the Bible.&nbsp; They were nice people, but more absolute vacancy
I never saw upon the countenances of human beings.</p>
<p>Theobald began by reading a few verses from the Old Testament, according
to some system of his own.&nbsp; On this occasion the passage came from
the fifteenth chapter of Numbers: it had no particular bearing that
I could see upon anything which was going on just then, but the spirit
which breathed throughout the whole seemed to me to be so like that
of Theobald himself, that I could understand better after hearing it,
how he came to think as he thought, and act as he acted.</p>
<p>The verses are as follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But the soul that doeth aught presumptuously,
whether he be born in the land or a stranger, the same reproacheth the
Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he hath despised the word of the Lord, and hath broken
His commandments, that soul shall be utterly cut off; his iniquity shall
be upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness they
found a man that gathered sticks upon the Sabbath day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto
Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they put him in ward because it was not declared what
should be done to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Lord said unto Moses, the man shall be surely put
to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the
camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and
stoned him with stones, and he died; as the Lord commanded Moses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they
make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their
generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband
of blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon
it and remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them, and that
ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ye may remember and do all my commandments and be holy
unto your God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the Lord your God which brought you out of the land of
Egypt, to be your God: I am the Lord your God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My thoughts wandered while Theobald was reading the above, and reverted
to a little matter which I had observed in the course of the afternoon.</p>
<p>It happened that some years previously, a swarm of bees had taken
up their abode in the roof of the house under the slates, and had multiplied
so that the drawing-room was a good deal frequented by these bees during
the summer, when the windows were open.&nbsp; The drawing-room paper
was of a pattern which consisted of bunches of red and white roses,
and I saw several bees at different times fly up to these bunches and
try them, under the impression that they were real flowers; having tried
one bunch, they tried the next, and the next, and the next, till they
reached the one that was nearest the ceiling, then they went down bunch
by bunch as they had ascended, till they were stopped by the back of
the sofa; on this they ascended bunch by bunch to the ceiling again;
and so on, and so on till I was tired of watching them.&nbsp; As I thought
of the family prayers being repeated night and morning, week by week,
month by month, and year by year, I could nor help thinking how like
it was to the way in which the bees went up the wall and down the wall,
bunch by bunch, without ever suspecting that so many of the associated
ideas could be present, and yet the main idea be wanting hopelessly,
and for ever.</p>
<p>When Theobald had finished reading we all knelt down and the Carlo
Dolci and the Sassoferrato looked down upon a sea of upturned backs,
as we buried our faces in our chairs.&nbsp; I noted that Theobald prayed
that we might be made &ldquo;truly honest and conscientious&rdquo; in
all our dealings, and smiled at the introduction of the &ldquo;truly.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then my thoughts ran back to the bees and I reflected that after all
it was perhaps as well at any rate for Theobald that our prayers were
seldom marked by any very encouraging degree of response, for if I had
thought there was the slightest chance of my being heard I should have
prayed that some one might ere long treat him as he had treated Ernest.</p>
<p>Then my thoughts wandered on to those calculations which people make
about waste of time and how much one can get done if one gives ten minutes
a day to it, and I was thinking what improper suggestion I could make
in connection with this and the time spent on family prayers which should
at the same time be just tolerable, when I heard Theobald beginning
&ldquo;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo; and in a few seconds
the ceremony was over, and the servants filed out again as they had
filed in.</p>
<p>As soon as they had left the drawing-room, Christina, who was a little
ashamed of the transaction to which I had been a witness, imprudently
returned to it, and began to justify it, saying that it cut her to the
heart, and that it cut Theobald to the heart and a good deal more, but
that &ldquo;it was the only thing to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I received this as coldly as I decently could, and by my silence
during the rest of the evening showed that I disapproved of what I had
seen.</p>
<p>Next day I was to go back to London, but before I went I said I should
like to take some new-laid eggs back with me, so Theobald took me to
the house of a labourer in the village who lived a stone&rsquo;s throw
from the Rectory as being likely to supply me with them.&nbsp; Ernest,
for some reason or other, was allowed to come too.&nbsp; I think the
hens had begun to sit, but at any rate eggs were scarce, and the cottager&rsquo;s
wife could not find me more than seven or eight, which we proceeded
to wrap up in separate pieces of paper so that I might take them to
town safely.</p>
<p>This operation was carried on upon the ground in front of the cottage
door, and while we were in the midst of it the cottager&rsquo;s little
boy, a lad much about Ernest&rsquo;s age, trod upon one of the eggs
that was wrapped up in paper and broke it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now, Jack,&rdquo; said his mother, &ldquo;see what you&rsquo;ve
done, you&rsquo;ve broken a nice egg and cost me a penny&mdash;Here,
Emma,&rdquo; she added, calling her daughter, &ldquo;take the child
away, there&rsquo;s a dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emma came at once, and walked off with the youngster, taking him
out of harm&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; said Ernest, after we had left the house, &ldquo;Why
didn&rsquo;t Mrs Heaton whip Jack when he trod on the egg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was spiteful enough to give Theobald a grim smile which said as
plainly as words could have done that I thought Ernest had hit him rather
hard.</p>
<p>Theobald coloured and looked angry.&nbsp; &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo;
he said quickly, &ldquo;that his mother will whip him now that we are
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was not going to have this and said I did not believe it, and so
the matter dropped, but Theobald did not forget it and my visits to
Battersby were henceforth less frequent.</p>
<p>On our return to the house we found the postman had arrived and had
brought a letter appointing Theobald to a rural deanery which had lately
fallen vacant by the death of one of the neighbouring clergy who had
held the office for many years.&nbsp; The bishop wrote to Theobald most
warmly, and assured him that he valued him as among the most hard-working
and devoted of his parochial clergy.&nbsp; Christina of course was delighted,
and gave me to understand that it was only an instalment of the much
higher dignities which were in store for Theobald when his merits were
more widely known.</p>
<p>I did not then foresee how closely my godson&rsquo;s life and mine
were in after years to be bound up together; if I had, I should doubtless
have looked upon him with different eyes and noted much to which I paid
no attention at the time.&nbsp; As it was, I was glad to get away from
him, for I could do nothing for him, or chose to say that I could not,
and the sight of so much suffering was painful to me.&nbsp; A man should
not only have his own way as far as possible, but he should only consort
with things that are getting their own way so far that they are at any
rate comfortable.&nbsp; Unless for short times under exceptional circumstances,
he should not even see things that have been stunted or starved, much
less should he eat meat that has been vexed by having been over-driven
or underfed, or afflicted with any disease; nor should he touch vegetables
that have not been well grown.&nbsp; For all these things cross a man;
whatever a man comes in contact with in any way forms a cross with him
which will leave him better or worse, and the better things he is crossed
with the more likely he is to live long and happily.&nbsp; All things
must be crossed a little or they would cease to live&mdash;but holy
things, such for example as Giovanni Bellini&rsquo;s saints, have been
crossed with nothing but what is good of its kind,</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<p>The storm which I have described in the previous chapter was a sample
of those that occurred daily for many years.&nbsp; No matter how clear
the sky, it was always liable to cloud over now in one quarter now in
another, and the thunder and lightning were upon the young people before
they knew where they were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, you know,&rdquo; said Ernest to me, when I asked
him not long since to give me more of his childish reminiscences for
the benefit of my story, &ldquo;we used to learn Mrs Barbauld&rsquo;s
hymns; they were in prose, and there was one about the lion which began,
&lsquo;Come, and I will show you what is strong.&nbsp; The lion is strong;
when he raiseth himself from his lair, when he shaketh his mane, when
the voice of his roaring is heard the cattle of the field fly, and the
beasts of the desert hide themselves, for he is very terrible.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I used to say this to Joey and Charlotte about my father himself when
I got a little older, but they were always didactic, and said it was
naughty of me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One great reason why clergymen&rsquo;s households are generally
unhappy is because the clergyman is so much at home or close about the
house.&nbsp; The doctor is out visiting patients half his time: the
lawyer and the merchant have offices away from home, but the clergyman
has no official place of business which shall ensure his being away
from home for many hours together at stated times.&nbsp; Our great days
were when my father went for a day&rsquo;s shopping to Gildenham.&nbsp;
We were some miles from this place, and commissions used to accumulate
on my father&rsquo;s list till he would make a day of it and go and
do the lot.&nbsp; As soon as his back was turned the air felt lighter;
as soon as the hall door opened to let him in again, the law with its
all-reaching &lsquo;touch not, taste not, handle not&rsquo; was upon
us again.&nbsp; The worst of it was that I could never trust Joey and
Charlotte; they would go a good way with me and then turn back, or even
the whole way and then their consciences would compel them to tell papa
and mamma.&nbsp; They liked running with the hare up to a certain point,
but their instinct was towards the hounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that the family
is a survival of the principle which is more logically embodied in the
compound animal&mdash;and the compound animal is a form of life which
has been found incompatible with high development.&nbsp; I would do
with the family among mankind what nature has done with the compound
animal, and confine it to the lower and less progressive races.&nbsp;
Certainly there is no inherent love for the family system on the part
of nature herself.&nbsp; Poll the forms of life and you will find it
in a ridiculously small minority.&nbsp; The fishes know it not, and
they get along quite nicely.&nbsp; The ants and the bees, who far outnumber
man, sting their fathers to death as a matter of course, and are given
to the atrocious mutilation of nine-tenths of the offspring committed
to their charge, yet where shall we find communities more universally
respected?&nbsp; Take the cuckoo again&mdash;is there any bird which
we like better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw he was running off from his own reminiscences and tried to
bring him back to them, but it was no use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fool,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a man is to remember anything
that happened more than a week ago unless it was pleasant, or unless
he wants to make some use of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sensible people get the greater part of their own dying done
during their own lifetime.&nbsp; A man at five and thirty should no
more regret not having had a happier childhood than he should regret
not having been born a prince of the blood.&nbsp; He might be happier
if he had been more fortunate in childhood, but, for aught he knows,
if he had, something else might have happened which might have killed
him long ago.&nbsp; If I had to be born again I would be born at Battersby
of the same father and mother as before, and I would not alter anything
that has ever happened to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most amusing incident that I can remember about his childhood
was that when he was about seven years old he told me he was going to
have a natural child.&nbsp; I asked him his reasons for thinking this,
and he explained that papa and mamma had always told him that nobody
had children till they were married, and as long as he had believed
this of course he had had no idea of having a child, till he was grown
up; but not long since he had been reading Mrs Markham&rsquo;s history
of England and had come upon the words &ldquo;John of Gaunt had several
natural children&rdquo; he had therefore asked his governess what a
natural child was&mdash;were not all children natural?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;a natural child is a
child a person has before he is married.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this it seemed
to follow logically that if John of Gaunt had had children before he
was married, he, Ernest Pontifex, might have them also, and he would
be obliged to me if I would tell him what he had better do under the
circumstances.</p>
<p>I enquired how long ago he had made this discovery.&nbsp; He said
about a fortnight, and he did not know where to look for the child,
for it might come at any moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;babies come so suddenly; one goes to bed one night and next morning
there is a baby.&nbsp; Why, it might die of cold if we are not on the
look-out for it.&nbsp; I hope it will be a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have told your governess about this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but she puts me off and does not help me: she says it
will not come for many years, and she hopes not then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you quite sure that you have not made any mistake in all
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; because Mrs Burne, you know, called here a few days
ago, and I was sent for to be looked at.&nbsp; And mamma held me out
at arm&rsquo;s length and said, &lsquo;Is he Mr Pontifex&rsquo;s child,
Mrs Burne, or is he mine?&rsquo;&nbsp; Of course, she couldn&rsquo;t
have said this if papa had not had some of the children himself.&nbsp;
I did think the gentleman had all the boys and the lady all the girls;
but it can&rsquo;t be like this, or else mamma would not have asked
Mrs Burne to guess; but then Mrs Burne said, &lsquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s Mr
Pontifex&rsquo;s child <i>of course</i>,&rsquo; and I didn&rsquo;t quite
know what she meant by saying &lsquo;of course&rsquo;: it seemed as
though I was right in thinking that the husband has all the boys and
the wife all the girls; I wish you would explain to me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This I could hardly do, so I changed the conversation, after reassuring
him as best I could.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<p>Three or four years after the birth of her daughter, Christina had
had one more child.&nbsp; She had never been strong since she married,
and had a presentiment that she should not survive this last confinement.&nbsp;
She accordingly wrote the following letter, which was to be given, as
she endorsed upon it, to her sons when Ernest was sixteen years old.&nbsp;
It reached him on his mother&rsquo;s death many years later, for it
was the baby who died now, and not Christina.&nbsp; It was found among
papers which she had repeatedly and carefully arranged, with the seal
already broken.&nbsp; This, I am afraid, shows that Christina had read
it and thought it too creditable to be destroyed when the occasion that
had called it forth had gone by.&nbsp; It is as follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;BATTERSBY, March 15th, 1841.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Two Dear Boys,&mdash;When this is put into your hands will
you try to bring to mind the mother whom you lost in your childhood,
and whom, I fear, you will almost have forgotten?&nbsp; You, Ernest,
will remember her best, for you are past five years old, and the many,
many times that she has taught you your prayers and hymns and sums and
told you stories, and our happy Sunday evenings will not quite have
passed from your mind, and you, Joey, though only four, will perhaps
recollect some of these things.&nbsp; My dear, dear boys, for the sake
of that mother who loved you very dearly&mdash;and for the sake of your
own happiness for ever and ever&mdash;attend to and try to remember,
and from time to time read over again the last words she can ever speak
to you.&nbsp; When I think about leaving you all, two things press heavily
upon me: one, your father&rsquo;s sorrow (for you, my darlings, after
missing me a little while, will soon forget your loss), the other, the
everlasting welfare of my children.&nbsp; I know how long and deep the
former will be, and I know that he will look to his children to be almost
his only earthly comfort.&nbsp; You know (for I am certain that it will
have been so), how he has devoted his life to you and taught you and
laboured to lead you to all that is right and good.&nbsp; Oh, then,
be sure that you <i>are</i> his comforts.&nbsp; Let him find you obedient,
affectionate and attentive to his wishes, upright, self-denying and
diligent; let him never blush for or grieve over the sins and follies
of those who owe him such a debt of gratitude, and whose first duty
it is to study his happiness.&nbsp; You have both of you a name which
must not be disgraced, a father and a grandfather of whom to show yourselves
worthy; your respectability and well-doing in life rest mainly with
yourselves, but far, far beyond earthly respectability and well-doing,
and compared with which they are as nothing, your eternal happiness
rests with yourselves.&nbsp; You know your duty, but snares and temptations
from without beset you, and the nearer you approach to manhood the more
strongly will you feel this.&nbsp; With God&rsquo;s help, with God&rsquo;s
word, and with humble hearts you will stand in spite of everything,
but should you leave off seeking in earnest for the first, and applying
to the second, should you learn to trust in yourselves, or to the advice
and example of too many around you, you will, you must fall.&nbsp; Oh,
&lsquo;let God be true and every man a liar.&rsquo;&nbsp; He says you
cannot serve Him and Mammon.&nbsp; He says that strait is the gate that
leads to eternal life.&nbsp; Many there are who seek to widen it; they
will tell you that such and such self-indulgences are but venial offences&mdash;that
this and that worldly compliance is excusable and even necessary.&nbsp;
The thing <i>cannot be</i>; for in a hundred and a hundred places He
tells you so&mdash;look to your Bibles and seek there whether such counsel
is true&mdash;and if not, oh, &lsquo;halt not between two opinions,&rsquo;
if God is the Lord follow Him; only be strong and of a good courage,
and He will never leave you nor forsake you.&nbsp; Remember, there is
not in the Bible one law for the rich, and one for the poor&mdash;one
for the educated and one for the ignorant.&nbsp; To <i>all</i> there
is but one thing needful.&nbsp; <i>All</i> are to be living to God and
their fellow-creatures, and not to themselves.&nbsp; <i>All</i> must
seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness&mdash;must <i>deny
themselves</i>, be pure and chaste and charitable in the fullest and
widest sense&mdash;all, &lsquo;forgetting those things that are behind,&rsquo;
must &lsquo;press forward towards the mark, for the prize of the high
calling of God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I will add but two things more.&nbsp; Be true through
life to each other, love as only brothers should do, strengthen, warn,
encourage one another, and let who will be against you, let each feel
that in his brother he has a firm and faithful friend who will be so
to the end; and, oh! be kind and watchful over your dear sister; without
mother or sisters she will doubly need her brothers&rsquo; love and
tenderness and confidence.&nbsp; I am certain she will seek them, and
will love you and try to make you happy; be sure then that you do not
fail her, and remember, that were she to lose her father and remain
unmarried, she would doubly need protectors.&nbsp; To you, then, I especially
commend her.&nbsp; Oh! my three darling children, be true to each other,
your Father, and your God.&nbsp; May He guide and bless you, and grant
that in a better and happier world I and mine may meet again.&mdash;Your
most affectionate mother,</p>
<p>CHRISTINA PONTIFEX.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From enquiries I have made, I have satisfied myself that most mothers
write letters like this shortly before their confinements, and that
fifty per cent. keep them afterwards, as Christina did.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<p>The foregoing letter shows how much greater was Christina&rsquo;s
anxiety for the eternal than for the temporal welfare of her sons.&nbsp;
One would have thought she had sowed enough of such religious wild oats
by this time, but she had plenty still to sow.&nbsp; To me it seems
that those who are happy in this world are better and more lovable people
than those who are not, and that thus in the event of a Resurrection
and Day of Judgement, they will be the most likely to be deemed worthy
of a heavenly mansion.&nbsp; Perhaps a dim unconscious perception of
this was the reason why Christina was so anxious for Theobald&rsquo;s
earthly happiness, or was it merely due to a conviction that his eternal
welfare was so much a matter of course, that it only remained to secure
his earthly happiness?&nbsp; He was to &ldquo;find his sons obedient,
affectionate, attentive to his wishes, self-denying and diligent,&rdquo;
a goodly string forsooth of all the virtues most convenient to parents;
he was never to have to blush for the follies of those &ldquo;who owed
him such a debt of gratitude,&rdquo; and &ldquo;whose first duty it
was to study his happiness.&rdquo;&nbsp; How like maternal solicitude
is this!&nbsp; Solicitude for the most part lest the offspring should
come to have wishes and feelings of its own, which may occasion many
difficulties, fancied or real.&nbsp; It is this that is at the bottom
of the whole mischief; but whether this last proposition is granted
or no, at any rate we observe that Christina had a sufficiently keen
appreciation of the duties of children towards their parents, and felt
the task of fulfilling them adequately to be so difficult that she was
very doubtful how far Ernest and Joey would succeed in mastering it.&nbsp;
It is plain in fact that her supposed parting glance upon them was one
of suspicion.&nbsp; But there was no suspicion of Theobald; that he
should have devoted his life to his children&mdash;why this was such
a mere platitude, as almost to go without saying.</p>
<p>How, let me ask, was it possible that a child only a little past
five years old, trained in such an atmosphere of prayers and hymns and
sums and happy Sunday evenings&mdash;to say nothing of daily repeated
beatings over the said prayers and hymns, etc., about which our authoress
is silent&mdash;how was it possible that a lad so trained should grow
up in any healthy or vigorous development, even though in her own way
his mother was undoubtedly very fond of him, and sometimes told him
stories?&nbsp; Can the eye of any reader fail to detect the coming wrath
of God as about to descend upon the head of him who should be nurtured
under the shadow of such a letter as the foregoing?</p>
<p>I have often thought that the Church of Rome does wisely in not allowing
her priests to marry.&nbsp; Certainly it is a matter of common observation
in England that the sons of clergymen are frequently unsatisfactory.&nbsp;
The explanation is very simple, but is so often lost sight of that I
may perhaps be pardoned for giving it here.</p>
<p>The clergyman is expected to be a kind of human Sunday.&nbsp; Things
must not be done in him which are venial in the week-day classes.&nbsp;
He is paid for this business of leading a stricter life than other people.&nbsp;
It is his <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i>.&nbsp; If his parishioners
feel that he does this, they approve of him, for they look upon him
as their own contribution towards what they deem a holy life.&nbsp;
This is why the clergyman is so often called a vicar&mdash;he being
the person whose vicarious goodness is to stand for that of those entrusted
to his charge.&nbsp; But his home is his castle as much as that of any
other Englishman, and with him, as with others, unnatural tension in
public is followed by exhaustion when tension is no longer necessary.&nbsp;
His children are the most defenceless things he can reach, and it is
on them in nine cases out of ten that he will relieve his mind.</p>
<p>A clergyman, again, can hardly ever allow himself to look facts fairly
in the face.&nbsp; It is his profession to support one side; it is impossible,
therefore, for him to make an unbiassed examination of the other.</p>
<p>We forget that every clergyman with a living or curacy, is as much
a paid advocate as the barrister who is trying to persuade a jury to
acquit a prisoner.&nbsp; We should listen to him with the same suspense
of judgment, the same full consideration of the arguments of the opposing
counsel, as a judge does when he is trying a case.&nbsp; Unless we know
these, and can state them in a way that our opponents would admit to
be a fair representation of their views, we have no right to claim that
we have formed an opinion at all.&nbsp; The misfortune is that by the
law of the land one side only can be heard.</p>
<p>Theobald and Christina were no exceptions to the general rule.&nbsp;
When they came to Battersby they had every desire to fulfil the duties
of their position, and to devote themselves to the honour and glory
of God.&nbsp; But it was Theobald&rsquo;s duty to see the honour and
glory of God through the eyes of a Church which had lived three hundred
years without finding reason to change a single one of its opinions.</p>
<p>I should doubt whether he ever got as far as doubting the wisdom
of his Church upon any single matter.&nbsp; His scent for possible mischief
was tolerably keen; so was Christina&rsquo;s, and it is likely that
if either of them detected in him or herself the first faint symptoms
of a want of faith they were nipped no less peremptorily in the bud,
than signs of self-will in Ernest were&mdash;and I should imagine more
successfully.&nbsp; Yet Theobald considered himself, and was generally
considered to be, and indeed perhaps was, an exceptionally truthful
person; indeed he was generally looked upon as an embodiment of all
those virtues which make the poor respectable and the rich respected.&nbsp;
In the course of time he and his wife became persuaded even to unconsciousness,
that no one could even dwell under their roof without deep cause for
thankfulness.&nbsp; Their children, their servants, their parishioners
must be fortunate <i>ipso facto</i> that they were theirs.&nbsp; There
was no road to happiness here or hereafter, but the road that they had
themselves travelled, no good people who did not think as they did upon
every subject, and no reasonable person who had wants the gratification
of which would be inconvenient to them&mdash;Theobald and Christina.</p>
<p>This was how it came to pass that their children were white and puny;
they were suffering from <i>home-sickness</i>.&nbsp; They were starving,
through being over-crammed with the wrong things.&nbsp; Nature came
down upon them, but she did not come down on Theobald and Christina.&nbsp;
Why should she?&nbsp; They were not leading a starved existence.&nbsp;
There are two classes of people in this world, those who sin, and those
who are sinned against; if a man must belong to either, he had better
belong to the first than to the second.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<p>I will give no more of the details of my hero&rsquo;s earlier years.&nbsp;
Enough that he struggled through them, and at twelve years old knew
every page of his Latin and Greek Grammars by heart.&nbsp; He had read
the greater part of Virgil, Horace and Livy, and I do not know how many
Greek plays: he was proficient in arithmetic, knew the first four books
of Euclid thoroughly, and had a fair knowledge of French.&nbsp; It was
now time he went to school, and to school he was accordingly to go,
under the famous Dr Skinner of Roughborough.</p>
<p>Theobald had known Dr Skinner slightly at Cambridge.&nbsp; He had
been a burning and a shining light in every position he had filled from
his boyhood upwards.&nbsp; He was a very great genius.&nbsp; Everyone
knew this; they said, indeed, that he was one of the few people to whom
the word genius could be applied without exaggeration.&nbsp; Had he
not taken I don&rsquo;t know how many University Scholarships in his
freshman&rsquo;s year?&nbsp; Had he not been afterwards Senior Wrangler,
First Chancellor&rsquo;s Medallist and I do not know how many more things
besides?&nbsp; And then, he was such a wonderful speaker; at the Union
Debating Club he had been without a rival, and had, of course, been
president; his moral character,&mdash;a point on which so many geniuses
were weak&mdash;was absolutely irreproachable; foremost of all, however,
among his many great qualities, and perhaps more remarkable even than
his genius was what biographers have called &ldquo;the simple-minded
and child-like earnestness of his character,&rdquo; an earnestness which
might be perceived by the solemnity with which he spoke even about trifles.&nbsp;
It is hardly necessary to say he was on the Liberal side in politics.</p>
<p>His personal appearance was not particularly prepossessing.&nbsp;
He was about the middle height, portly, and had a couple of fierce grey
eyes, that flashed fire from beneath a pair of great bushy beetling
eyebrows and overawed all who came near him.&nbsp; It was in respect
of his personal appearance, however, that, if he was vulnerable at all,
his weak place was to be found.&nbsp; His hair when he was a young man
was red, but after he had taken his degree he had a brain fever which
caused him to have his head shaved; when he reappeared, he did so wearing
a wig, and one which was a good deal further off red than his own hair
had been.&nbsp; He not only had never discarded his wig, but year by
year it had edged itself a little more and a little more off red, till
by the time he was forty, there was not a trace of red remaining, and
his wig was brown.</p>
<p>When Dr Skinner was a very young man, hardly more than five-and-twenty,
the head-mastership of Roughborough Grammar School had fallen vacant,
and he had been unhesitatingly appointed.&nbsp; The result justified
the selection.&nbsp; Dr Skinner&rsquo;s pupils distinguished themselves
at whichever University they went to.&nbsp; He moulded their minds after
the model of his own, and stamped an impression upon them which was
indelible in after-life; whatever else a Roughborough man might be,
he was sure to make everyone feel that he was a God-fearing earnest
Christian and a Liberal, if not a Radical, in politics.&nbsp; Some boys,
of course, were incapable of appreciating the beauty and loftiness of
Dr Skinner&rsquo;s nature.&nbsp; Some such boys, alas! there will be
in every school; upon them Dr Skinner&rsquo;s hand was very properly
a heavy one.&nbsp; His hand was against them, and theirs against him
during the whole time of the connection between them.&nbsp; They not
only disliked him, but they hated all that he more especially embodied,
and throughout their lives disliked all that reminded them of him.&nbsp;
Such boys, however, were in a minority, the spirit of the place being
decidedly Skinnerian.</p>
<p>I once had the honour of playing a game of chess with this great
man.&nbsp; It was during the Christmas holidays, and I had come down
to Roughborough for a few days to see Alethea Pontifex (who was then
living there) on business.&nbsp; It was very gracious of him to take
notice of me, for if I was a light of literature at all it was of the
very lightest kind.</p>
<p>It is true that in the intervals of business I had written a good
deal, but my works had been almost exclusively for the stage, and for
those theatres that devoted themselves to extravaganza and burlesque.&nbsp;
I had written many pieces of this description, full of puns and comic
songs, and they had had a fair success, but my best piece had been a
treatment of English history during the Reformation period, in the course
of which I had introduced Cranmer, Sir Thomas More, Henry the Eighth,
Catherine of Arragon, and Thomas Cromwell (in his youth better known
as the <i>Malleus Monachorum</i>), and had made them dance a break-down.&nbsp;
I had also dramatised &ldquo;The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rdquo; for
a Christmas Pantomime, and made an important scene of Vanity Fair, with
Mr Greatheart, Apollyon, Christiana, Mercy, and Hopeful as the principal
characters.&nbsp; The orchestra played music taken from Handel&rsquo;s
best known works, but the time was a good deal altered, and altogether
the tunes were not exactly as Handel left them.&nbsp; Mr Greatheart
was very stout and he had a red nose; he wore a capacious waistcoat,
and a shirt with a huge frill down the middle of the front.&nbsp; Hopeful
was up to as much mischief as I could give him; he wore the costume
of a young swell of the period, and had a cigar in his mouth which was
continually going out.</p>
<p>Christiana did not wear much of anything: indeed it was said that
the dress which the Stage Manager had originally proposed for her had
been considered inadequate even by the Lord Chamberlain, but this is
not the case.&nbsp; With all these delinquencies upon my mind it was
natural that I should feel convinced of sin while playing chess (which
I hate) with the great Dr Skinner of Roughborough&mdash;the historian
of Athens and editor of Demosthenes.&nbsp; Dr Skinner, moreover, was
one of those who pride themselves on being able to set people at their
ease at once, and I had been sitting on the edge of my chair all the
evening.&nbsp; But I have always been very easily overawed by a schoolmaster.</p>
<p>The game had been a long one, and at half-past nine, when supper
came in, we had each of us a few pieces remaining.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
will you take for supper, Dr Skinner?&rdquo; said Mrs Skinner in a silvery
voice.</p>
<p>He made no answer for some time, but at last in a tone of almost
superhuman solemnity, he said, first, &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; and then
&ldquo;Nothing whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By and by, however, I had a sense come over me as though I were nearer
the consummation of all things than I had ever yet been.&nbsp; The room
seemed to grow dark, as an expression came over Dr Skinner&rsquo;s face,
which showed that he was about to speak.&nbsp; The expression gathered
force, the room grew darker and darker.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; he
at length added, and I felt that here at any rate was an end to a suspense
which was rapidly becoming unbearable.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay&mdash;I may
presently take a glass of cold water&mdash;and a small piece of bread
and butter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said the word &ldquo;butter&rdquo; his voice sank to a hardly
audible whisper; then there was a sigh as though of relief when the
sentence was concluded, and the universe this time was safe.</p>
<p>Another ten minutes of solemn silence finished the game.&nbsp; The
Doctor rose briskly from his seat and placed himself at the supper table.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mrs Skinner,&rdquo; he exclaimed jauntily, &ldquo;what are those
mysterious-looking objects surrounded by potatoes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are oysters, Dr Skinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me some, and give Overton some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so on till he had eaten a good plate of oysters, a scallop shell
of minced veal nicely browned, some apple tart, and a hunk of bread
and cheese.&nbsp; This was the small piece of bread and butter.</p>
<p>The cloth was now removed and tumblers with teaspoons in them, a
lemon or two and a jug of boiling water were placed upon the table.&nbsp;
Then the great man unbent.&nbsp; His face beamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what shall it be to drink?&rdquo; he exclaimed persuasively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Shall it be brandy and water?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; It shall be gin
and water.&nbsp; Gin is the more wholesome liquor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So gin it was, hot and stiff too.</p>
<p>Who can wonder at him or do anything but pity him?&nbsp; Was he not
head-master of Roughborough School?&nbsp; To whom had he owed money
at any time?&nbsp; Whose ox had he taken, whose ass had he taken, or
whom had he defrauded?&nbsp; What whisper had ever been breathed against
his moral character?&nbsp; If he had become rich it was by the most
honourable of all means&mdash;his literary attainments; over and above
his great works of scholarship, his &ldquo;Meditations upon the Epistle
and Character of St Jude&rdquo; had placed him among the most popular
of English theologians; it was so exhaustive that no one who bought
it need ever meditate upon the subject again&mdash;indeed it exhausted
all who had anything to do with it.&nbsp; He had made &pound;5000 by
this work alone, and would very likely make another &pound;5000 before
he died.&nbsp; A man who had done all this and wanted a piece of bread
and butter had a right to announce the fact with some pomp and circumstance.&nbsp;
Nor should his words be taken without searching for what he used to
call a &ldquo;deeper and more hidden meaning.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those who
searched for this even in his lightest utterances would not be without
their reward.&nbsp; They would find that &ldquo;bread and butter&rdquo;
was Skinnerese for oyster-patties and apple tart, and &ldquo;gin hot&rdquo;
the true translation of water.</p>
<p>But independently of their money value, his works had made him a
lasting name in literature.&nbsp; So probably Gallio was under the impression
that his fame would rest upon the treatises on natural history which
we gather from Seneca that he compiled, and which for aught we know
may have contained a complete theory of evolution; but the treatises
are all gone and Gallio has become immortal for the very last reason
in the world that he expected, and for the very last reason that would
have flattered his vanity.&nbsp; He has become immortal because he cared
nothing about the most important movement with which he was ever brought
into connection (I wish people who are in search of immortality would
lay the lesson to heart and not make so much noise about important movements),
and so, if Dr Skinner becomes immortal, it will probably be for some
reason very different from the one which he so fondly imagined.</p>
<p>Could it be expected to enter into the head of such a man as this
that in reality he was making his money by corrupting youth; that it
was his paid profession to make the worse appear the better reason in
the eyes of those who were too young and inexperienced to be able to
find him out; that he kept out of the sight of those whom he professed
to teach material points of the argument, for the production of which
they had a right to rely upon the honour of anyone who made professions
of sincerity; that he was a passionate half-turkey-cock half-gander
of a man whose sallow, bilious face and hobble-gobble voice could scare
the timid, but who would take to his heels readily enough if he were
met firmly; that his &ldquo;Meditations on St Jude,&rdquo; such as they
were, were cribbed without acknowledgment, and would have been beneath
contempt if so many people did not believe them to have been written
honestly?&nbsp; Mrs Skinner might have perhaps kept him a little more
in his proper place if she had thought it worth while to try, but she
had enough to attend to in looking after her household and seeing that
the boys were well fed and, if they were ill, properly looked after&mdash;which
she took good care they were.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<p>Ernest had heard awful accounts of Dr Skinner&rsquo;s temper, and
of the bullying which the younger boys at Roughborough had to put up
with at the hands of the bigger ones.&nbsp; He had now got about as
much as he could stand, and felt as though it must go hard with him
if his burdens of whatever kind were to be increased.&nbsp; He did not
cry on leaving home, but I am afraid he did on being told that he was
getting near Roughborough.&nbsp; His father and mother were with him,
having posted from home in their own carriage; Roughborough had as yet
no railway, and as it was only some forty miles from Battersby, this
was the easiest way of getting there.</p>
<p>On seeing him cry, his mother felt flattered and caressed him.&nbsp;
She said she knew he must feel very sad at leaving such a happy home,
and going among people who, though they would be very good to him, could
never, never be as good as his dear papa and she had been; still, she
was herself, if he only knew it, much more deserving of pity than he
was, for the parting was more painful to her than it could possibly
be to him, etc., and Ernest, on being told that his tears were for grief
at leaving home, took it all on trust, and did not trouble to investigate
the real cause of his tears.&nbsp; As they approached Roughborough he
pulled himself together, and was fairly calm by the time he reached
Dr Skinner&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>On their arrival they had luncheon with the Doctor and his wife,
and then Mrs Skinner took Christina over the bedrooms, and showed her
where her dear little boy was to sleep.</p>
<p>Whatever men may think about the study of man, women do really believe
the noblest study for womankind to be woman, and Christina was too much
engrossed with Mrs Skinner to pay much attention to anything else; I
daresay Mrs Skinner, too, was taking pretty accurate stock of Christina.&nbsp;
Christina was charmed, as indeed she generally was with any new acquaintance,
for she found in them (and so must we all) something of the nature of
a cross; as for Mrs Skinner, I imagine she had seen too many Christinas
to find much regeneration in the sample now before her; I believe her
private opinion echoed the dictum of a well-known head-master who declared
that all parents were fools, but more especially mothers; she was, however,
all smiles and sweetness, and Christina devoured these graciously as
tributes paid more particularly to herself, and such as no other mother
would have been at all likely to have won.</p>
<p>In the meantime Theobald and Ernest were with Dr Skinner in his library&mdash;the
room where new boys were examined and old ones had up for rebuke or
chastisement.&nbsp; If the walls of that room could speak, what an amount
of blundering and capricious cruelty would they not bear witness to!</p>
<p>Like all houses, Dr Skinner&rsquo;s had its peculiar smell.&nbsp;
In this case the prevailing odour was one of Russia leather, but along
with it there was a subordinate savour as of a chemist&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp;
This came from a small laboratory in one corner of the room&mdash;the
possession of which, together with the free chattery and smattery use
of such words as &ldquo;carbonate,&rdquo; &ldquo;hyposulphite,&rdquo;
&ldquo;phosphate,&rdquo; and &ldquo;affinity,&rdquo; were enough to
convince even the most sceptical that Dr Skinner had a profound knowledge
of chemistry.</p>
<p>I may say in passing that Dr Skinner had dabbled in a great many
other things as well as chemistry.&nbsp; He was a man of many small
knowledges, and each of them dangerous.&nbsp; I remember Alethea Pontifex
once said in her wicked way to me, that Dr Skinner put her in mind of
the Bourbon princes on their return from exile after the battle of Waterloo,
only that he was their exact converse; for whereas they had learned
nothing and forgotten nothing, Dr Skinner had learned everything and
forgotten everything.&nbsp; And this puts me in mind of another of her
wicked sayings about Dr Skinner.&nbsp; She told me one day that he had
the harmlessness of the serpent and the wisdom of the dove.</p>
<p>But to return to Dr Skinner&rsquo;s library; over the chimney-piece
there was a Bishop&rsquo;s half length portrait of Dr Skinner himself,
painted by the elder Pickersgill, whose merit Dr Skinner had been among
the first to discern and foster.&nbsp; There were no other pictures
in the library, but in the dining-room there was a fine collection,
which the doctor had got together with his usual consummate taste.&nbsp;
He added to it largely in later life, and when it came to the hammer
at Christie&rsquo;s, as it did not long since, it was found to comprise
many of the latest and most matured works of Solomon Hart, O&rsquo;Neil,
Charles Landseer, and more of our recent Academicians than I can at
the moment remember.&nbsp; There were thus brought together and exhibited
at one view many works which had attracted attention at the Academy
Exhibitions, and as to whose ultimate destiny there had been some curiosity.&nbsp;
The prices realised were disappointing to the executors, but, then,
these things are so much a matter of chance.&nbsp; An unscrupulous writer
in a well-known weekly paper had written the collection down.&nbsp;
Moreover there had been one or two large sales a short time before Dr
Skinner&rsquo;s, so that at this last there was rather a panic, and
a reaction against the high prices that had ruled lately.</p>
<p>The table of the library was loaded with books many deep; MSS. of
all kinds were confusedly mixed up with them,&mdash;boys&rsquo; exercises,
probably, and examination papers&mdash;but all littering untidily about.&nbsp;
The room in fact was as depressing from its slatternliness as from its
atmosphere of erudition.&nbsp; Theobald and Ernest as they entered it,
stumbled over a large hole in the Turkey carpet, and the dust that rose
showed how long it was since it had been taken up and beaten.&nbsp;
This, I should say, was no fault of Mrs Skinner&rsquo;s but was due
to the Doctor himself, who declared that if his papers were once disturbed
it would be the death of him.&nbsp; Near the window was a green cage
containing a pair of turtle doves, whose plaintive cooing added to the
melancholy of the place.&nbsp; The walls were covered with book shelves
from floor to ceiling, and on every shelf the books stood in double
rows.&nbsp; It was horrible.&nbsp; Prominent among the most prominent
upon the most prominent shelf were a series of splendidly bound volumes
entitled &ldquo;Skinner&rsquo;s Works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boys are sadly apt to rush to conclusions, and Ernest believed that
Dr Skinner knew all the books in this terrible library, and that he,
if he were to be any good, should have to learn them too.&nbsp; His
heart fainted within him.</p>
<p>He was told to sit on a chair against the wall and did so, while
Dr Skinner talked to Theobald upon the topics of the day.&nbsp; He talked
about the Hampden Controversy then raging, and discoursed learnedly
about &ldquo;Praemunire&rdquo;; then he talked about the revolution
which had just broken out in Sicily, and rejoiced that the Pope had
refused to allow foreign troops to pass through his dominions in order
to crush it.&nbsp; Dr Skinner and the other masters took in the Times
among them, and Dr Skinner echoed the <i>Times</i>&rsquo; leaders.&nbsp;
In those days there were no penny papers and Theobald only took in the
<i>Spectator</i>&mdash;for he was at that time on the Whig side in politics;
besides this he used to receive the <i>Ecclesiastical Gazette</i> once
a month, but he saw no other papers, and was amazed at the ease and
fluency with which Dr Skinner ran from subject to subject.</p>
<p>The Pope&rsquo;s action in the matter of the Sicilian revolution
naturally led the Doctor to the reforms which his Holiness had introduced
into his dominions, and he laughed consumedly over the joke which had
not long since appeared in <i>Punch</i>, to the effect that Pio &ldquo;No,
No,&rdquo; should rather have been named Pio &ldquo;Yes, Yes,&rdquo;
because, as the doctor explained, he granted everything his subjects
asked for.&nbsp; Anything like a pun went straight to Dr Skinner&rsquo;s
heart.</p>
<p>Then he went on to the matter of these reforms themselves.&nbsp;
They opened up a new era in the history of Christendom, and would have
such momentous and far-reaching consequences, that they might even lead
to a reconciliation between the Churches of England and Rome.&nbsp;
Dr Skinner had lately published a pamphlet upon this subject, which
had shown great learning, and had attacked the Church of Rome in a way
which did not promise much hope of reconciliation.&nbsp; He had grounded
his attack upon the letters A.M.D.G., which he had seen outside a Roman
Catholic chapel, and which of course stood for <i>Ad Mariam Dei Genetricem</i>.&nbsp;
Could anything be more idolatrous?</p>
<p>I am told, by the way, that I must have let my memory play me one
of the tricks it often does play me, when I said the Doctor proposed
<i>Ad Mariam Dei Genetricem</i> as the full harmonies, so to speak,
which should be constructed upon the bass A.M.D.G., for that this is
bad Latin, and that the doctor really harmonised the letters thus: <i>Ave
Maria Dei Genetrix</i>.&nbsp; No doubt the doctor did what was right
in the matter of Latinity&mdash;I have forgotten the little Latin I
ever knew, and am not going to look the matter up, but I believe the
doctor said <i>Ad Mariam Dei Genetricem</i>, and if so we may be sure
that <i>Ad Mariam Dei Genetricem</i>, is good enough Latin at any rate
for ecclesiastical purposes.</p>
<p>The reply of the local priest had not yet appeared, and Dr Skinner
was jubilant, but when the answer appeared, and it was solemnly declared
that A.M.D.G. stood for nothing more dangerous than <i>Ad Majorem Dei
Gloriam</i>, it was felt that though this subterfuge would not succeed
with any intelligent Englishman, still it was a pity Dr Skinner had
selected this particular point for his attack, for he had to leave his
enemy in possession of the field.&nbsp; When people are left in possession
of the field, spectators have an awkward habit of thinking that their
adversary does not dare to come to the scratch.</p>
<p>Dr Skinner was telling Theobald all about his pamphlet, and I doubt
whether this gentleman was much more comfortable than Ernest himself.&nbsp;
He was bored, for in his heart he hated Liberalism, though he was ashamed
to say so, and, as I have said, professed to be on the Whig side.&nbsp;
He did not want to be reconciled to the Church of Rome; he wanted to
make all Roman Catholics turn Protestants, and could never understand
why they would not do so; but the Doctor talked in such a truly liberal
spirit, and shut him up so sharply when he tried to edge in a word or
two, that he had to let him have it all his own way, and this was not
what he was accustomed to.&nbsp; He was wondering how he could bring
it to an end, when a diversion was created by the discovery that Ernest
had begun to cry&mdash;doubtless through an intense but inarticulate
sense of a boredom greater than he could bear.&nbsp; He was evidently
in a highly nervous state, and a good deal upset by the excitement of
the morning, Mrs Skinner therefore, who came in with Christina at this
juncture, proposed that he should spend the afternoon with Mrs Jay,
the matron, and not be introduced to his young companions until the
following morning.&nbsp; His father and mother now bade him an affectionate
farewell, and the lad was handed over to Mrs Jay.</p>
<p>O schoolmasters&mdash;if any of you read this book&mdash;bear in
mind when any particularly timid drivelling urchin is brought by his
papa into your study, and you treat him with the contempt which he deserves,
and afterwards make his life a burden to him for years&mdash;bear in
mind that it is exactly in the disguise of such a boy as this that your
future chronicler will appear.&nbsp; Never see a wretched little heavy-eyed
mite sitting on the edge of a chair against your study wall without
saying to yourselves, &ldquo;perhaps this boy is he who, if I am not
careful, will one day tell the world what manner of man I was.&rdquo;&nbsp;
If even two or three schoolmasters learn this lesson and remember it,
the preceding chapters will not have been written in vain.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<p>Soon after his father and mother had left him Ernest dropped asleep
over a book which Mrs Jay had given him, and he did not awake till dusk.&nbsp;
Then he sat down on a stool in front of the fire, which showed pleasantly
in the late January twilight, and began to muse.&nbsp; He felt weak,
feeble, ill at ease and unable to see his way out of the innumerable
troubles that were before him.&nbsp; Perhaps, he said to himself, he
might even die, but this, far from being an end of his troubles, would
prove the beginning of new ones; for at the best he would only go to
Grandpapa Pontifex and Grandmamma Allaby, and though they would perhaps
be more easy to get on with than Papa and Mamma, yet they were undoubtedly
not so really good, and were more worldly; moreover they were grown-up
people&mdash;especially Grandpapa Pontifex, who so far as he could understand
had been very much grown-up, and he did not know why, but there was
always something that kept him from loving any grown-up people very
much&mdash;except one or two of the servants, who had indeed been as
nice as anything that he could imagine.&nbsp; Besides even if he were
to die and go to Heaven he supposed he should have to complete his education
somewhere.</p>
<p>In the meantime his father and mother were rolling along the muddy
roads, each in his or her own corner of the carriage, and each revolving
many things which were and were not to come to pass.&nbsp; Times have
changed since I last showed them to the reader as sitting together silently
in a carriage, but except as regards their mutual relations, they have
altered singularly little.&nbsp; When I was younger I used to think
the Prayer Book was wrong in requiring us to say the General Confession
twice a week from childhood to old age, without making provision for
our not being quite such great sinners at seventy as we had been at
seven; granted that we should go to the wash like table-cloths at least
once a week, still I used to think a day ought to come when we should
want rather less rubbing and scrubbing at.&nbsp; Now that I have grown
older myself I have seen that the Church has estimated probabilities
better than I had done.</p>
<p>The pair said not a word to one another, but watched the fading light
and naked trees, the brown fields with here and there a melancholy cottage
by the road side, and the rain that fell fast upon the carriage windows.&nbsp;
It was a kind of afternoon on which nice people for the most part like
to be snug at home, and Theobald was a little snappish at reflecting
how many miles he had to post before he could be at his own fireside
again.&nbsp; However there was nothing for it, so the pair sat quietly
and watched the roadside objects flit by them, and get greyer and grimmer
as the light faded.</p>
<p>Though they spoke not to one another, there was one nearer to each
of them with whom they could converse freely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo;
said Theobald to himself, &ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;ll work&mdash;or else
that Skinner will make him.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like Skinner, I never
did like him, but he is unquestionably a man of genius, and no one turns
out so many pupils who succeed at Oxford and Cambridge, and that is
the best test.&nbsp; I have done my share towards starting him well.&nbsp;
Skinner said he had been well grounded and was very forward.&nbsp; I
suppose he will presume upon it now and do nothing, for his nature is
an idle one.&nbsp; He is not fond of me, I&rsquo;m sure he is not.&nbsp;
He ought to be after all the trouble I have taken with him, but he is
ungrateful and selfish.&nbsp; It is an unnatural thing for a boy not
to be fond of his own father.&nbsp; If he was fond of me I should be
fond of him, but I cannot like a son who, I am sure, dislikes me.&nbsp;
He shrinks out of my way whenever he sees me coming near him.&nbsp;
He will not stay five minutes in the same room with me if he can help
it.&nbsp; He is deceitful.&nbsp; He would not want to hide himself away
so much if he were not deceitful.&nbsp; That is a bad sign and one which
makes me fear he will grow up extravagant.&nbsp; I am sure he will grow
up extravagant.&nbsp; I should have given him more pocket-money if I
had not known this&mdash;but what is the good of giving him pocket-money?&nbsp;
It is all gone directly.&nbsp; If he doesn&rsquo;t buy something with
it he gives it away to the first little boy or girl he sees who takes
his fancy.&nbsp; He forgets that it&rsquo;s my money he is giving away.&nbsp;
I give him money that he may have money and learn to know its uses,
not that he may go and squander it immediately.&nbsp; I wish he was
not so fond of music, it will interfere with his Latin and Greek.&nbsp;
I will stop it as much as I can.&nbsp; Why, when he was translating
Livy the other day he slipped out Handel&rsquo;s name in mistake for
Hannibal&rsquo;s, and his mother tells me he knows half the tunes in
the &lsquo;Messiah&rsquo; by heart.&nbsp; What should a boy of his age
know about the &lsquo;Messiah&rsquo;?&nbsp; If I had shown half as many
dangerous tendencies when I was a boy, my father would have apprenticed
me to a greengrocer, of that I&rsquo;m very sure,&rdquo; etc., etc.</p>
<p>Then his thoughts turned to Egypt and the tenth plague.&nbsp; It
seemed to him that if the little Egyptians had been anything like Ernest,
the plague must have been something very like a blessing in disguise.&nbsp;
If the Israelites were to come to England now he should be greatly tempted
not to let them go.</p>
<p>Mrs Theobald&rsquo;s thoughts ran in a different current.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord
Lonsford&rsquo;s grandson&mdash;it&rsquo;s a pity his name is Figgins;
however, blood is blood as much through the female line as the male,
indeed, perhaps even more so if the truth were known.&nbsp; I wonder
who Mr Figgins was.&nbsp; I think Mrs Skinner said he was dead, however,
I must find out all about him.&nbsp; It would be delightful if young
Figgins were to ask Ernest home for the holidays.&nbsp; Who knows but
he might meet Lord Lonsford himself, or at any rate some of Lord Lonsford&rsquo;s
other descendants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the boy himself was still sitting moodily before the fire
in Mrs Jay&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Papa and Mamma,&rdquo; he was
saying to himself, &ldquo;are much better and cleverer than anyone else,
but, I, alas! shall never be either good or clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Pontifex continued&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it would be best to get young Figgins on a visit to
ourselves first.&nbsp; That would be charming.&nbsp; Theobald would
not like it, for he does not like children; I must see how I can manage
it, for it would be so nice to have young Figgins&mdash;or stay!&nbsp;
Ernest shall go and stay with Figgins and meet the future Lord Lonsford,
who I should think must be about Ernest&rsquo;s age, and then if he
and Ernest were to become friends Ernest might ask him to Battersby,
and he might fall in love with Charlotte.&nbsp; I think we have done
<i>most wisely</i> in sending Ernest to Dr Skinner&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Dr
Skinner&rsquo;s piety is no less remarkable than his genius.&nbsp; One
can tell these things at a glance, and he must have felt it about me
no less strongly than I about him.&nbsp; I think he seemed much struck
with Theobald and myself&mdash;indeed, Theobald&rsquo;s intellectual
power must impress any one, and I was showing, I do believe, to my best
advantage.&nbsp; When I smiled at him and said I left my boy in his
hands with the most entire confidence that he would be as well cared
for as if he were at my own house, I am sure he was greatly pleased.&nbsp;
I should not think many of the mothers who bring him boys can impress
him so favourably, or say such nice things to him as I did.&nbsp; My
smile is sweet when I desire to make it so.&nbsp; I never was perhaps
exactly pretty, but I was always admitted to be fascinating.&nbsp; Dr
Skinner is a very handsome man&mdash;too good on the whole I should
say for Mrs Skinner.&nbsp; Theobald says he is not handsome, but men
are no judges, and he has such a pleasant bright face.&nbsp; I think
my bonnet became me.&nbsp; As soon as I get home I will tell Chambers
to trim my blue and yellow merino with&mdash;&rdquo; etc., etc.</p>
<p>All this time the letter which has been given above was lying in
Christina&rsquo;s private little Japanese cabinet, read and re-read
and approved of many times over, not to say, if the truth were known,
rewritten more than once, though dated as in the first instance&mdash;and
this, too, though Christina was fond enough of a joke in a small way.</p>
<p>Ernest, still in Mrs Jay&rsquo;s room mused onward.&nbsp; &ldquo;Grown-up
people,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;when they were ladies and
gentlemen, never did naughty things, but he was always doing them.&nbsp;
He had heard that some grown-up people were worldly, which of course
was wrong, still this was quite distinct from being naughty, and did
not get them punished or scolded.&nbsp; His own Papa and Mamma were
not even worldly; they had often explained to him that they were exceptionally
unworldly; he well knew that they had never done anything naughty since
they had been children, and that even as children they had been nearly
faultless.&nbsp; Oh! how different from himself!&nbsp; When should he
learn to love his Papa and Mamma as they had loved theirs?&nbsp; How
could he hope ever to grow up to be as good and wise as they, or even
tolerably good and wise?&nbsp; Alas! never.&nbsp; It could not be.&nbsp;
He did not love his Papa and Mamma, in spite of all their goodness both
in themselves and to him.&nbsp; He hated Papa, and did not like Mamma,
and this was what none but a bad and ungrateful boy would do after all
that had been done for him.&nbsp; Besides he did not like Sunday; he
did not like anything that was really good; his tastes were low and
such as he was ashamed of.&nbsp; He liked people best if they sometimes
swore a little, so long as it was not at him.&nbsp; As for his Catechism
and Bible readings he had no heart in them.&nbsp; He had never attended
to a sermon in his life.&nbsp; Even when he had been taken to hear Mr
Vaughan at Brighton, who, as everyone knew, preached such beautiful
sermons for children, he had been very glad when it was all over, nor
did he believe he could get through church at all if it was not for
the voluntary upon the organ and the hymns and chanting.&nbsp; The Catechism
was awful.&nbsp; He had never been able to understand what it was that
he desired of his Lord God and Heavenly Father, nor had he yet got hold
of a single idea in connection with the word Sacrament.&nbsp; His duty
towards his neighbour was another bugbear.&nbsp; It seemed to him that
he had duties towards everybody, lying in wait for him upon every side,
but that nobody had any duties towards him.&nbsp; Then there was that
awful and mysterious word &lsquo;business.&rsquo;&nbsp; What did it
all mean?&nbsp; What was &lsquo;business&rsquo;?&nbsp; His Papa was
a wonderfully good man of business, his Mamma had often told him so&mdash;but
he should never be one.&nbsp; It was hopeless, and very awful, for people
were continually telling him that he would have to earn his own living.&nbsp;
No doubt, but how&mdash;considering how stupid, idle, ignorant, self-indulgent,
and physically puny he was?&nbsp; All grown-up people were clever, except
servants&mdash;and even these were cleverer than ever he should be.&nbsp;
Oh, why, why, why, could not people be born into the world as grown-up
persons?&nbsp; Then he thought of Casabianca.&nbsp; He had been examined
in that poem by his father not long before.&nbsp; &lsquo;When only would
he leave his position?&nbsp; To whom did he call?&nbsp; Did he get an
answer?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; How many times did he call upon his father?&nbsp;
What happened to him?&nbsp; What was the noblest life that perished
there?&nbsp; Do you think so?&nbsp; Why do you think so?&rsquo;&nbsp;
And all the rest of it.&nbsp; Of course he thought Casabianca&rsquo;s
was the noblest life that perished there; there could be no two opinions
about that; it never occurred to him that the moral of the poem was
that young people cannot begin too soon to exercise discretion in the
obedience they pay to their Papa and Mamma.&nbsp; Oh, no! the only thought
in his mind was that he should never, never have been like Casabianca,
and that Casabianca would have despised him so much, if he could have
known him, that he would not have condescended to speak to him.&nbsp;
There was nobody else in the ship worth reckoning at all: it did not
matter how much they were blown up.&nbsp; Mrs Hemans knew them all and
they were a very indifferent lot.&nbsp; Besides Casabianca was so good-looking
and came of such a good family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thus his small mind kept wandering on till he could follow it
no longer, and again went off into a doze.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<p>Next morning Theobald and Christina arose feeling a little tired
from their journey, but happy in that best of all happiness, the approbation
of their consciences.&nbsp; It would be their boy&rsquo;s fault henceforth
if he were not good, and as prosperous as it was at all desirable that
he should be.&nbsp; What more could parents do than they had done?&nbsp;
The answer &ldquo;Nothing&rdquo; will rise as readily to the lips of
the reader as to those of Theobald and Christina themselves.</p>
<p>A few days later the parents were gratified at receiving the following
letter from their son&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My Dear Mamma,&mdash;I am very well.&nbsp; Dr
Skinner made me do about the horse free and exulting roaming in the
wide fields in Latin verse, but as I had done it with Papa I knew how
to do it, and it was nearly all right, and he put me in the fourth form
under Mr Templer, and I have to begin a new Latin grammar not like the
old, but much harder.&nbsp; I know you wish me to work, and I will try
very hard.&nbsp; With best love to Joey and Charlotte, and to Papa,
I remain, your affectionate son, ERNEST.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing could be nicer or more proper.&nbsp; It really did seem as
though he were inclined to turn over a new leaf.&nbsp; The boys had
all come back, the examinations were over, and the routine of the half
year began; Ernest found that his fears about being kicked about and
bullied were exaggerated.&nbsp; Nobody did anything very dreadful to
him.&nbsp; He had to run errands between certain hours for the elder
boys, and to take his turn at greasing the footballs, and so forth,
but there was an excellent spirit in the school as regards bullying.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he was far from happy.&nbsp; Dr Skinner was much too
like his father.&nbsp; True, Ernest was not thrown in with him much
yet, but he was always there; there was no knowing at what moment he
might not put in an appearance, and whenever he did show, it was to
storm about something.&nbsp; He was like the lion in the Bishop of Oxford&rsquo;s
Sunday story&mdash;always liable to rush out from behind some bush and
devour some one when he was least expected.&nbsp; He called Ernest &ldquo;an
audacious reptile&rdquo; and said he wondered the earth did not open
and swallow him up because he pronounced Thalia with a short i.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And this to me,&rdquo; he thundered, &ldquo;who never made a
false quantity in my life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely he would have been a
much nicer person if he had made false quantities in his youth like
other people.&nbsp; Ernest could not imagine how the boys in Dr Skinner&rsquo;s
form continued to live; but yet they did, and even throve, and, strange
as it may seem, idolised him, or professed to do so in after life.&nbsp;
To Ernest it seemed like living on the crater of Vesuvius.</p>
<p>He was himself, as has been said, in Mr Templer&rsquo;s form, who
was snappish, but not downright wicked, and was very easy to crib under.&nbsp;
Ernest used to wonder how Mr Templer could be so blind, for he supposed
Mr Templer must have cribbed when he was at school, and would ask himself
whether he should forget his youth when he got old, as Mr Templer had
forgotten his.&nbsp; He used to think he never could possibly forget
any part of it.</p>
<p>Then there was Mrs Jay, who was sometimes very alarming.&nbsp; A
few days after the half year had commenced, there being some little
extra noise in the hall, she rushed in with her spectacles on her forehead
and her cap strings flying, and called the boy whom Ernest had selected
as his hero the &ldquo;rampingest-scampingest-rackety-tackety-tow-row-roaringest
boy in the whole school.&rdquo;&nbsp; But she used to say things that
Ernest liked.&nbsp; If the Doctor went out to dinner, and there were
no prayers, she would come in and say, &ldquo;Young gentlemen, prayers
are excused this evening&rdquo;; and, take her for all in all, she was
a kindly old soul enough.</p>
<p>Most boys soon discover the difference between noise and actual danger,
but to others it is so unnatural to menace, unless they mean mischief,
that they are long before they leave off taking turkey-cocks and ganders
<i>au s&eacute;rieux</i>.&nbsp; Ernest was one of the latter sort, and
found the atmosphere of Roughborough so gusty that he was glad to shrink
out of sight and out of mind whenever he could.&nbsp; He disliked the
games worse even than the squalls of the class-room and hall, for he
was still feeble, not filling out and attaining his full strength till
a much later age than most boys.&nbsp; This was perhaps due to the closeness
with which his father had kept him to his books in childhood, but I
think in part also to a tendency towards lateness in attaining maturity,
hereditary in the Pontifex family, which was one also of unusual longevity.&nbsp;
At thirteen or fourteen he was a mere bag of bones, with upper arms
about as thick as the wrists of other boys of his age; his little chest
was pigeon-breasted; he appeared to have no strength or stamina whatever,
and finding he always went to the wall in physical encounters, whether
undertaken in jest or earnest, even with boys shorter than himself,
the timidity natural to childhood increased upon him to an extent that
I am afraid amounted to cowardice.&nbsp; This rendered him even less
capable than he might otherwise have been, for as confidence increases
power, so want of confidence increases impotence.&nbsp; After he had
had the breath knocked out of him and been well shinned half a dozen
times in scrimmages at football&mdash;scrimmages in which he had become
involved sorely against his will&mdash;he ceased to see any further
fun in football, and shirked that noble game in a way that got him into
trouble with the elder boys, who would stand no shirking on the part
of the younger ones.</p>
<p>He was as useless and ill at ease with cricket as with football,
nor in spite of all his efforts could he ever throw a ball or a stone.&nbsp;
It soon became plain, therefore, to everyone that Pontifex was a young
muff, a mollycoddle, not to be tortured, but still not to be rated highly.&nbsp;
He was not however, actively unpopular, for it was seen that he was
quite square <i>inter pares</i>, not at all vindictive, easily pleased,
perfectly free with whatever little money he had, no greater lover of
his school work than of the games, and generally more inclinable to
moderate vice than to immoderate virtue.</p>
<p>These qualities will prevent any boy from sinking very low in the
opinion of his schoolfellows; but Ernest thought he had fallen lower
than he probably had, and hated and despised himself for what he, as
much as anyone else, believed to be his cowardice.&nbsp; He did not
like the boys whom he thought like himself.&nbsp; His heroes were strong
and vigorous, and the less they inclined towards him the more he worshipped
them.&nbsp; All this made him very unhappy, for it never occurred to
him that the instinct which made him keep out of games for which he
was ill adapted, was more reasonable than the reason which would have
driven him into them.&nbsp; Nevertheless he followed his instinct for
the most part, rather than his reason.&nbsp; <i>Sapiens suam si sapientiam
n&ocirc;rit</i>.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<p>With the masters Ernest was ere long in absolute disgrace.&nbsp;
He had more liberty now than he had known heretofore.&nbsp; The heavy
hand and watchful eye of Theobald were no longer about his path and
about his bed and spying out all his ways; and punishment by way of
copying out lines of Virgil was a very different thing from the savage
beatings of his father.&nbsp; The copying out in fact was often less
trouble than the lesson.&nbsp; Latin and Greek had nothing in them which
commended them to his instinct as likely to bring him peace even at
the last; still less did they hold out any hope of doing so within some
more reasonable time.&nbsp; The deadness inherent in these defunct languages
themselves had never been artificially counteracted by a system of <i>bona
fide</i> rewards for application.&nbsp; There had been any amount of
punishments for want of application, but no good comfortable bribes
had baited the hook which was to allure him to his good.</p>
<p>Indeed, the more pleasant side of learning to do this or that had
always been treated as something with which Ernest had no concern.&nbsp;
We had no business with pleasant things at all, at any rate very little
business, at any rate not he, Ernest.&nbsp; We were put into this world
not for pleasure but duty, and pleasure had in it something more or
less sinful in its very essence.&nbsp; If we were doing anything we
liked, we, or at any rate he, Ernest, should apologise and think he
was being very mercifully dealt with, if not at once told to go and
do something else.&nbsp; With what he did not like, however, it was
different; the more he disliked a thing the greater the presumption
that it was right.&nbsp; It never occurred to him that the presumption
was in favour of the rightness of what was most pleasant, and that the
onus of proving that it was not right lay with those who disputed its
being so.&nbsp; I have said more than once that he believed in his own
depravity; never was there a little mortal more ready to accept without
cavil whatever he was told by those who were in authority over him:
he thought, at least, that he believed it, for as yet he knew nothing
of that other Ernest that dwelt within him, and was so much stronger
and more real than the Ernest of which he was conscious.&nbsp; The dumb
Ernest persuaded with inarticulate feelings too swift and sure to be
translated into such debateable things as words, but practically insisted
as follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Growing is not the easy plain sailing business
that it is commonly supposed to be: it is hard work&mdash;harder than
any but a growing boy can understand; it requires attention, and you
are not strong enough to attend to your bodily growth, and to your lessons
too.&nbsp; Besides, Latin and Greek are great humbug; the more people
know of them the more odious they generally are; the nice people whom
you delight in either never knew any at all or forgot what they had
learned as soon as they could; they never turned to the classics after
they were no longer forced to read them; therefore they are nonsense,
all very well in their own time and country, but out of place here.&nbsp;
Never learn anything until you find you have been made uncomfortable
for a good long while by not knowing it; when you find that you have
occasion for this or that knowledge, or foresee that you will have occasion
for it shortly, the sooner you learn it the better, but till then spend
your time in growing bone and muscle; these will be much more useful
to you than Latin and Greek, nor will you ever be able to make them
if you do not do so now, whereas Latin and Greek can be acquired at
any time by those who want them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are surrounded on every side by lies which would deceive
even the elect, if the elect were not generally so uncommonly wide awake;
the self of which you are conscious, your reasoning and reflecting self,
will believe these lies and bid you act in accordance with them.&nbsp;
This conscious self of yours, Ernest, is a prig begotten of prigs and
trained in priggishness; I will not allow it to shape your actions,
though it will doubtless shape your words for many a year to come.&nbsp;
Your papa is not here to beat you now; this is a change in the conditions
of your existence, and should be followed by changed actions.&nbsp;
Obey me, your true self, and things will go tolerably well with you,
but only listen to that outward and visible old husk of yours which
is called your father, and I will rend you in pieces even unto the third
and fourth generation as one who has hated God; for I, Ernest, am the
God who made you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How shocked Ernest would have been if he could have heard the advice
he was receiving; what consternation too there would have been at Battersby;
but the matter did not end here, for this same wicked inner self gave
him bad advice about his pocket money, the choice of his companions
and on the whole Ernest was attentive and obedient to its behests, more
so than Theobald had been.&nbsp; The consequence was that he learned
little, his mind growing more slowly and his body rather faster than
heretofore: and when by and by his inner self urged him in directions
where he met obstacles beyond his strength to combat, he took&mdash;though
with passionate compunctions of conscience&mdash;the nearest course
to the one from which he was debarred which circumstances would allow.</p>
<p>It may be guessed that Ernest was not the chosen friend of the more
sedate and well-conducted youths then studying at Roughborough.&nbsp;
Some of the less desirable boys used to go to public-houses and drink
more beer than was good for them; Ernest&rsquo;s inner self can hardly
have told him to ally himself to these young gentlemen, but he did so
at an early age, and was sometimes made pitiably sick by an amount of
beer which would have produced no effect upon a stronger boy.&nbsp;
Ernest&rsquo;s inner self must have interposed at this point and told
him that there was not much fun in this, for he dropped the habit ere
it had taken firm hold of him, and never resumed it; but he contracted
another at the disgracefully early age of between thirteen and fourteen
which he did not relinquish, though to the present day his conscious
self keeps dinging it into him that the less he smokes the better.</p>
<p>And so matters went on till my hero was nearly fourteen years old.&nbsp;
If by that time he was not actually a young blackguard, he belonged
to a debateable class between the sub-reputable and the upper disreputable,
with perhaps rather more leaning to the latter except so far as vices
of meanness were concerned, from which he was fairly free.&nbsp; I gather
this partly from what Ernest has told me, and partly from his school
bills which I remember Theobald showed me with much complaining.&nbsp;
There was an institution at Roughborough called the monthly merit money;
the maximum sum which a boy of Ernest&rsquo;s age could get was four
shillings and sixpence; several boys got four shillings and few less
than sixpence, but Ernest never got more than half-a-crown and seldom
more than eighteen pence; his average would, I should think, be about
one and nine pence, which was just too much for him to rank among the
downright bad boys, but too little to put him among the good ones.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<p>I must now return to Miss Alethea Pontifex, of whom I have said perhaps
too little hitherto, considering how great her influence upon my hero&rsquo;s
destiny proved to be.</p>
<p>On the death of her father, which happened when she was about thirty-two
years old, she parted company with her sisters, between whom and herself
there had been little sympathy, and came up to London.&nbsp; She was
determined, so she said, to make the rest of her life as happy as she
could, and she had clearer ideas about the best way of setting to work
to do this than women, or indeed men, generally have.</p>
<p>Her fortune consisted, as I have said, of &pound;5000, which had
come to her by her mother&rsquo;s marriage settlements, and &pound;15,000
left her by her father, over both which sums she had now absolute control.&nbsp;
These brought her in about &pound;900 a year, and the money being invested
in none but the soundest securities, she had no anxiety about her income.&nbsp;
She meant to be rich, so she formed a scheme of expenditure which involved
an annual outlay of about &pound;500, and determined to put the rest
by.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I do this,&rdquo; she said laughingly, &ldquo;I
shall probably just succeed in living comfortably within my income.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In accordance with this scheme she took unfurnished apartments in a
house in Gower Street, of which the lower floors were let out as offices.&nbsp;
John Pontifex tried to get her to take a house to herself, but Alethea
told him to mind his own business so plainly that he had to beat a retreat.&nbsp;
She had never liked him, and from that time dropped him almost entirely.</p>
<p>Without going much into society she yet became acquainted with most
of the men and women who had attained a position in the literary, artistic
and scientific worlds, and it was singular how highly her opinion was
valued in spite of her never having attempted in any way to distinguish
herself.&nbsp; She could have written if she had chosen, but she enjoyed
seeing others write and encouraging them better than taking a more active
part herself.&nbsp; Perhaps literary people liked her all the better
because she did not write.</p>
<p>I, as she very well knew, had always been devoted to her, and she
might have had a score of other admirers if she had liked, but she had
discouraged them all, and railed at matrimony as women seldom do unless
they have a comfortable income of their own.&nbsp; She by no means,
however, railed at man as she railed at matrimony, and though living
after a fashion in which even the most censorious could find nothing
to complain of, as far as she properly could she defended those of her
own sex whom the world condemned most severely.</p>
<p>In religion she was, I should think, as nearly a freethinker as anyone
could be whose mind seldom turned upon the subject.&nbsp; She went to
church, but disliked equally those who aired either religion or irreligion.&nbsp;
I remember once hearing her press a late well-known philosopher to write
a novel instead of pursuing his attacks upon religion.&nbsp; The philosopher
did not much like this, and dilated upon the importance of showing people
the folly of much that they pretended to believe.&nbsp; She smiled and
said demurely, &ldquo;Have they not Moses and the prophets?&nbsp; Let
them hear them.&rdquo;&nbsp; But she would say a wicked thing quietly
on her own account sometimes, and called my attention once to a note
in her prayer-book which gave account of the walk to Emmaus with the
two disciples, and how Christ had said to them &ldquo;O fools and slow
of heart to believe ALL that the prophets have spoken&rdquo;&mdash;the
&ldquo;all&rdquo; being printed in small capitals.</p>
<p>Though scarcely on terms with her brother John, she had kept up closer
relations with Theobald and his family, and had paid a few days&rsquo;
visit to Battersby once in every two years or so.&nbsp; Alethea had
always tried to like Theobald and join forces with him as much as she
could (for they two were the hares of the family, the rest being all
hounds), but it was no use.&nbsp; I believe her chief reason for maintaining
relations with her brother was that she might keep an eye on his children
and give them a lift if they proved nice.</p>
<p>When Miss Pontifex had come down to Battersby in old times the children
had not been beaten, and their lessons had been made lighter.&nbsp;
She easily saw that they were overworked and unhappy, but she could
hardly guess how all-reaching was the r&eacute;gime under which they
lived.&nbsp; She knew she could not interfere effectually then, and
wisely forbore to make too many enquiries.&nbsp; Her time, if ever it
was to come, would be when the children were no longer living under
the same roof as their parents.&nbsp; It ended in her making up her
mind to have nothing to do with either Joey or Charlotte, but to see
so much of Ernest as should enable her to form an opinion about his
disposition and abilities.</p>
<p>He had now been a year and a half at Roughborough and was nearly
fourteen years old, so that his character had begun to shape.&nbsp;
His aunt had not seen him for some little time and, thinking that if
she was to exploit him she could do so now perhaps better than at any
other time, she resolved to go down to Roughborough on some pretext
which should be good enough for Theobald, and to take stock of her nephew
under circumstances in which she could get him for some few hours to
herself.&nbsp; Accordingly in August 1849, when Ernest was just entering
on his fourth half year a cab drove up to Dr Skinner&rsquo;s door with
Miss Pontifex, who asked and obtained leave for Ernest to come and dine
with her at the Swan Hotel.&nbsp; She had written to Ernest to say she
was coming and he was of course on the look-out for her.&nbsp; He had
not seen her for so long that he was rather shy at first, but her good
nature soon set him at his ease.&nbsp; She was so strongly biassed in
favour of anything young that her heart warmed towards him at once,
though his appearance was less prepossessing than she had hoped.&nbsp;
She took him to a cake shop and gave him whatever he liked as soon as
she had got him off the school premises; and Ernest felt at once that
she contrasted favourably even with his aunts the Misses Allaby, who
were so very sweet and good.&nbsp; The Misses Allaby were very poor;
sixpence was to them what five shillings was to Alethea.&nbsp; What
chance had they against one who, if she had a mind, could put by out
of her income twice as much as they, poor women, could spend?</p>
<p>The boy had plenty of prattle in him when he was not snubbed, and
Alethea encouraged him to chatter about whatever came uppermost.&nbsp;
He was always ready to trust anyone who was kind to him; it took many
years to make him reasonably wary in this respect&mdash;if indeed, as
I sometimes doubt, he ever will be as wary as he ought to be&mdash;and
in a short time he had quite dissociated his aunt from his papa and
mamma and the rest, with whom his instinct told him he should be on
his guard.&nbsp; Little did he know how great, as far as he was concerned,
were the issues that depended upon his behaviour.&nbsp; If he had known,
he would perhaps have played his part less successfully.</p>
<p>His aunt drew from him more details of his home and school life than
his papa and mamma would have approved of, but he had no idea that he
was being pumped.&nbsp; She got out of him all about the happy Sunday
evenings, and how he and Joey and Charlotte quarrelled sometimes, but
she took no side and treated everything as though it were a matter of
course.&nbsp; Like all the boys, he could mimic Dr Skinner, and when
warmed with dinner, and two glasses of sherry which made him nearly
tipsy, he favoured his aunt with samples of the Doctor&rsquo;s manner
and spoke of him familiarly as &ldquo;Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is an awful old humbug.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was the sherry that brought out this piece of swagger, for whatever
else he was Dr Skinner was a reality to Master Ernest, before which,
indeed, he sank into his boots in no time.&nbsp; Alethea smiled and
said, &ldquo;I must not say anything to that, must I?&rdquo;&nbsp; Ernest
said, &ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; and was checked.&nbsp; By-and-by
he vented a number of small second-hand priggishnesses which he had
caught up believing them to be the correct thing, and made it plain
that even at that early age Ernest believed in Ernest with a belief
which was amusing from its absurdity.&nbsp; His aunt judged him charitably
as she was sure to do; she knew very well where the priggishness came
from, and seeing that the string of his tongue had been loosened sufficiently
gave him no more sherry.</p>
<p>It was after dinner, however, that he completed the conquest of his
aunt.&nbsp; She then discovered that, like herself, he was passionately
fond of music, and that, too, of the highest class.&nbsp; He knew, and
hummed or whistled to her all sorts of pieces out of the works of the
great masters, which a boy of his age could hardly be expected to know,
and it was evident that this was purely instinctive, inasmuch as music
received no kind of encouragement at Roughborough.&nbsp; There was no
boy in the school as fond of music as he was.&nbsp; He picked up his
knowledge, he said, from the organist of St Michael&rsquo;s Church who
used to practise sometimes on a week-day afternoon.&nbsp; Ernest had
heard the organ booming away as he was passing outside the church and
had sneaked inside and up into the organ loft.&nbsp; In the course of
time the organist became accustomed to him as a familiar visitant, and
the pair became friends.</p>
<p>It was this which decided Alethea that the boy was worth taking pains
with.&nbsp; &ldquo;He likes the best music,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;and
he hates Dr Skinner.&nbsp; This is a very fair beginning.&rdquo;&nbsp;
When she sent him away at night with a sovereign in his pocket (and
he had only hoped to get five shillings) she felt as though she had
had a good deal more than her money&rsquo;s worth for her money.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<p>Next day Miss Pontifex returned to town, with her thoughts full of
her nephew and how she could best be of use to him.</p>
<p>It appeared to her that to do him any real service she must devote
herself almost entirely to him; she must in fact give up living in London,
at any rate for a long time, and live at Roughborough where she could
see him continually.&nbsp; This was a serious undertaking; she had lived
in London for the last twelve years, and naturally disliked the prospect
of a small country town such as Roughborough.&nbsp; Was it a prudent
thing to attempt so much?&nbsp; Must not people take their chances in
this world?&nbsp; Can anyone do much for anyone else unless by making
a will in his favour and dying then and there?&nbsp; Should not each
look after his own happiness, and will not the world be best carried
on if everyone minds his own business and leaves other people to mind
theirs?&nbsp; Life is not a donkey race in which everyone is to ride
his neighbour&rsquo;s donkey and the last is to win, and the psalmist
long since formulated a common experience when he declared that no man
may deliver his brother nor make agreement unto God for him, for it
cost more to redeem their souls, so that he must let that alone for
ever.</p>
<p>All these excellent reasons for letting her nephew alone occurred
to her, and many more, but against them there pleaded a woman&rsquo;s
love for children, and her desire to find someone among the younger
branches of her own family to whom she could become warmly attached,
and whom she could attach warmly to herself.</p>
<p>Over and above this she wanted someone to leave her money to; she
was not going to leave it to people about whom she knew very little,
merely because they happened to be sons and daughters of brothers and
sisters whom she had never liked.&nbsp; She knew the power and value
of money exceedingly well, and how many lovable people suffer and die
yearly for the want of it; she was little likely to leave it without
being satisfied that her legatees were square, lovable, and more or
less hard up.&nbsp; She wanted those to have it who would be most likely
to use it genially and sensibly, and whom it would thus be likely to
make most happy; if she could find one such among her nephews and nieces,
so much the better; it was worth taking a great deal of pains to see
whether she could or could not; but if she failed, she must find an
heir who was not related to her by blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she had said to me, more than once, &ldquo;I
shall make a mess of it.&nbsp; I shall choose some nice-looking, well-dressed
screw, with gentlemanly manners which will take me in, and he will go
and paint Academy pictures, or write for the <i>Times</i>, or do something
just as horrid the moment the breath is out of my body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As yet, however, she had made no will at all, and this was one of
the few things that troubled her.&nbsp; I believe she would have left
most of her money to me if I had not stopped her.&nbsp; My father left
me abundantly well off, and my mode of life has been always simple,
so that I have never known uneasiness about money; moreover I was especially
anxious that there should be no occasion given for ill-natured talk;
she knew well, therefore, that her leaving her money to me would be
of all things the most likely to weaken the ties that existed between
us, provided that I was aware of it, but I did not mind her talking
about whom she should make her heir, so long as it was well understood
that I was not to be the person.</p>
<p>Ernest had satisfied her as having enough in him to tempt her strongly
to take him up, but it was not till after many days&rsquo; reflection
that she gravitated towards actually doing so, with all the break in
her daily ways that this would entail.&nbsp; At least, she said it took
her some days, and certainly it appeared to do so, but from the moment
she had begun to broach the subject, I had guessed how things were going
to end.</p>
<p>It was now arranged she should take a house at Roughborough, and
go and live there for a couple of years.&nbsp; As a compromise, however,
to meet some of my objections, it was also arranged that she should
keep her rooms in Gower Street, and come to town for a week once in
each month; of course, also, she would leave Roughborough for the greater
part of the holidays.&nbsp; After two years, the thing was to come to
an end, unless it proved a great success.&nbsp; She should by that time,
at any rate, have made up her mind what the boy&rsquo;s character was,
and would then act as circumstances might determine.</p>
<p>The pretext she put forward ostensibly was that her doctor said she
ought to be a year or two in the country after so many years of London
life, and had recommended Roughborough on account of the purity of its
air, and its easy access to and from London&mdash;for by this time the
railway had reached it.&nbsp; She was anxious not to give her brother
and sister any right to complain, if on seeing more of her nephew she
found she could not get on with him, and she was also anxious not to
raise false hopes of any kind in the boy&rsquo;s own mind.</p>
<p>Having settled how everything was to be, she wrote to Theobald and
said she meant to take a house in Roughborough from the Michaelmas then
approaching, and mentioned, as though casually, that one of the attractions
of the place would be that her nephew was at school there and she should
hope to see more of him than she had done hitherto.</p>
<p>Theobald and Christina knew how dearly Alethea loved London, and
thought it very odd that she should want to go and live at Roughborough,
but they did not suspect that she was going there solely on her nephew&rsquo;s
account, much less that she had thought of making Ernest her heir.&nbsp;
If they had guessed this, they would have been so jealous that I half
believe they would have asked her to go and live somewhere else.&nbsp;
Alethea however, was two or three years younger than Theobald; she was
still some years short of fifty, and might very well live to eighty-five
or ninety; her money, therefore, was not worth taking much trouble about,
and her brother and sister-in-law had dismissed it, so to speak, from
their minds with costs, assuming, however, that if anything did happen
to her while they were still alive, the money would, as a matter of
course, come to them.</p>
<p>The prospect of Alethea seeing much of Ernest was a serious matter.&nbsp;
Christina smelt mischief from afar, as indeed she often did.&nbsp; Alethea
was worldly&mdash;as worldly, that is to say, as a sister of Theobald&rsquo;s
could be.&nbsp; In her letter to Theobald she had said she knew how
much of his and Christina&rsquo;s thoughts were taken up with anxiety
for the boy&rsquo;s welfare.&nbsp; Alethea had thought this handsome
enough, but Christina had wanted something better and stronger.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How can she know how much we think of our darling?&rdquo; she
had exclaimed, when Theobald showed her his sister&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I think, my dear, Alethea would understand these things better
if she had children of her own.&rdquo;&nbsp; The least that would have
satisfied Christina was to have been told that there never yet had been
any parents comparable to Theobald and herself.&nbsp; She did not feel
easy that an alliance of some kind would not grow up between aunt and
nephew, and neither she nor Theobald wanted Ernest to have any allies.&nbsp;
Joey and Charlotte were quite as many allies as were good for him.&nbsp;
After all, however, if Alethea chose to go and live at Roughborough,
they could not well stop her, and must make the best of it.</p>
<p>In a few weeks&rsquo; time Alethea did choose to go and live at Roughborough.&nbsp;
A house was found with a field and a nice little garden which suited
her very well.&nbsp; &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; she said to herself,
&ldquo;I will have fresh eggs and flowers.&rdquo;&nbsp; She even considered
the question of keeping a cow, but in the end decided not to do so.&nbsp;
She furnished her house throughout anew, taking nothing whatever from
her establishment in Gower Street, and by Michaelmas&mdash;for the house
was empty when she took it&mdash;she was settled comfortably, and had
begun to make herself at home.</p>
<p>One of Miss Pontifex&rsquo;s first moves was to ask a dozen of the
smartest and most gentlemanly boys to breakfast with her.&nbsp; From
her seat in church she could see the faces of the upper-form boys, and
soon made up her mind which of them it would be best to cultivate.&nbsp;
Miss Pontifex, sitting opposite the boys in church, and reckoning them
up with her keen eyes from under her veil by all a woman&rsquo;s criteria,
came to a truer conclusion about the greater number of those she scrutinized
than even Dr Skinner had done.&nbsp; She fell in love with one boy from
seeing him put on his gloves.</p>
<p>Miss Pontifex, as I have said, got hold of some of these youngsters
through Ernest, and fed them well.&nbsp; No boy can resist being fed
well by a good-natured and still handsome woman.&nbsp; Boys are very
like nice dogs in this respect&mdash;give them a bone and they will
like you at once.&nbsp; Alethea employed every other little artifice
which she thought likely to win their allegiance to herself, and through
this their countenance for her nephew.&nbsp; She found the football
club in a slight money difficulty and at once gave half a sovereign
towards its removal.&nbsp; The boys had no chance against her, she shot
them down one after another as easily as though they had been roosting
pheasants.&nbsp; Nor did she escape scathless herself, for, as she wrote
to me, she quite lost her heart to half a dozen of them.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
much nicer they are,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and how much more they
know than those who profess to teach them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I believe it has been lately maintained that it is the young and
fair who are the truly old and truly experienced, inasmuch as it is
they who alone have a living memory to guide them; &ldquo;the whole
charm,&rdquo; it has been said, &ldquo;of youth lies in its advantage
over age in respect of experience, and when this has for some reason
failed or been misapplied, the charm is broken.&nbsp; When we say that
we are getting old, we should say rather that we are getting new or
young, and are suffering from inexperience; trying to do things which
we have never done before, and failing worse and worse, till in the
end we are landed in the utter impotence of death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pontifex died many a long year before the above passage was
written, but she had arrived independently at much the same conclusion.</p>
<p>She first, therefore, squared the boys.&nbsp; Dr Skinner was even
more easily dealt with.&nbsp; He and Mrs Skinner called, as a matter
of course, as soon as Miss Pontifex was settled.&nbsp; She fooled him
to the top of his bent, and obtained the promise of a MS. copy of one
of his minor poems (for Dr Skinner had the reputation of being quite
one of our most facile and elegant minor poets) on the occasion of his
first visit.&nbsp; The other masters and masters&rsquo; wives were not
forgotten.&nbsp; Alethea laid herself out to please, as indeed she did
wherever she went, and if any woman lays herself out to do this, she
generally succeeds.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<p>Miss Pontifex soon found out that Ernest did not like games, but
she saw also that he could hardly be expected to like them.&nbsp; He
was perfectly well shaped but unusually devoid of physical strength.&nbsp;
He got a fair share of this in after life, but it came much later with
him than with other boys, and at the time of which I am writing he was
a mere little skeleton.&nbsp; He wanted something to develop his arms
and chest without knocking him about as much as the school games did.&nbsp;
To supply this want by some means which should add also to his pleasure
was Alethea&rsquo;s first anxiety.&nbsp; Rowing would have answered
every purpose, but unfortunately there was no river at Roughborough.</p>
<p>Whatever it was to be, it must be something which he should like
as much as other boys liked cricket or football, and he must think the
wish for it to have come originally from himself; it was not very easy
to find anything that would do, but ere long it occurred to her that
she might enlist his love of music on her side, and asked him one day
when he was spending a half-holiday at her house whether he would like
her to buy an organ for him to play on.&nbsp; Of course, the boy said
yes; then she told him about her grandfather and the organs he had built.&nbsp;
It had never entered into his head that he could make one, but when
he gathered from what his aunt had said that this was not out of the
question, he rose as eagerly to the bait as she could have desired,
and wanted to begin learning to saw and plane so that he might make
the wooden pipes at once.</p>
<p>Miss Pontifex did not see how she could have hit upon anything more
suitable, and she liked the idea that he would incidentally get a knowledge
of carpentering, for she was impressed, perhaps foolishly, with the
wisdom of the German custom which gives every boy a handicraft of some
sort.</p>
<p>Writing to me on this matter, she said &ldquo;Professions are all
very well for those who have connection and interest as well as capital,
but otherwise they are white elephants.&nbsp; How many men do not you
and I know who have talent, assiduity, excellent good sense, straightforwardness,
every quality in fact which should command success, and who yet go on
from year to year waiting and hoping against hope for the work which
never comes?&nbsp; How, indeed, is it likely to come unless to those
who either are born with interest, or who marry in order to get it?&nbsp;
Ernest&rsquo;s father and mother have no interest, and if they had they
would not use it.&nbsp; I suppose they will make him a clergyman, or
try to do so&mdash;perhaps it is the best thing to do with him, for
he could buy a living with the money his grandfather left him, but there
is no knowing what the boy will think of it when the time comes, and
for aught we know he may insist on going to the backwoods of America,
as so many other young men are doing now.&rdquo;&nbsp; . . . But, anyway,
he would like making an organ, and this could do him no harm, so the
sooner he began the better.</p>
<p>Alethea thought it would save trouble in the end if she told her
brother and sister-in-law of this scheme.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not suppose,&rdquo;
she wrote, &ldquo;that Dr Skinner will approve very cordially of my
attempt to introduce organ-building into the <i>curriculum</i> of Roughborough,
but I will see what I can do with him, for I have set my heart on owning
an organ built by Ernest&rsquo;s own hands, which he may play on as
much as he likes while it remains in my house and which I will lend
him permanently as soon as he gets one of his own, but which is to be
my property for the present, inasmuch as I mean to pay for it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This was put in to make it plain to Theobald and Christina that they
should not be out of pocket in the matter.</p>
<p>If Alethea had been as poor as the Misses Allaby, the reader may
guess what Ernest&rsquo;s papa and mamma would have said to this proposal;
but then, if she had been as poor as they, she would never have made
it.&nbsp; They did not like Ernest&rsquo;s getting more and more into
his aunt&rsquo;s good books, still it was perhaps better that he should
do so than that she should be driven back upon the John Pontifexes.&nbsp;
The only thing, said Theobald, which made him hesitate, was that the
boy might be thrown with low associates later on if he were to be encouraged
in his taste for music&mdash;a taste which Theobald had always disliked.&nbsp;
He had observed with regret that Ernest had ere now shown rather a hankering
after low company, and he might make acquaintance with those who would
corrupt his innocence.&nbsp; Christina shuddered at this, but when they
had aired their scruples sufficiently they felt (and when people begin
to &ldquo;feel,&rdquo; they are invariably going to take what they believe
to be the more worldly course) that to oppose Alethea&rsquo;s proposal
would be injuring their son&rsquo;s prospects more than was right, so
they consented, but not too graciously.</p>
<p>After a time, however, Christina got used to the idea, and then considerations
occurred to her which made her throw herself into it with characteristic
ardour.&nbsp; If Miss Pontifex had been a railway stock she might have
been said to have been buoyant in the Battersby market for some few
days; buoyant for long together she could never be, still for a time
there really was an upward movement.&nbsp; Christina&rsquo;s mind wandered
to the organ itself; she seemed to have made it with her own hands;
there would be no other in England to compare with it for combined sweetness
and power.&nbsp; She already heard the famous Dr Walmisley of Cambridge
mistaking it for a Father Smith.&nbsp; It would come, no doubt, in reality
to Battersby Church, which wanted an organ, for it must be all nonsense
about Alethea&rsquo;s wishing to keep it, and Ernest would not have
a house of his own for ever so many years, and they could never have
it at the Rectory.&nbsp; Oh, no!&nbsp; Battersby Church was the only
proper place for it.</p>
<p>Of course, they would have a grand opening, and the Bishop would
come down, and perhaps young Figgins might be on a visit to them&mdash;she
must ask Ernest if young Figgins had yet left Roughborough&mdash;he
might even persuade his grandfather Lord Lonsford to be present.&nbsp;
Lord Lonsford and the Bishop and everyone else would then compliment
her, and Dr Wesley or Dr Walmisley, who should preside (it did not much
matter which), would say to her, &ldquo;My dear Mrs Pontifex, I never
yet played upon so remarkable an instrument.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she would
give him one of her very sweetest smiles and say she feared he was flattering
her, on which he would rejoin with some pleasant little trifle about
remarkable men (the remarkable man being for the moment Ernest) having
invariably had remarkable women for their mothers&mdash;and so on and
so on.&nbsp; The advantage of doing one&rsquo;s praising for oneself
is that one can lay it on so thick and exactly in the right places.</p>
<p>Theobald wrote Ernest a short and surly letter <i>&agrave; propos</i>
of his aunt&rsquo;s intentions in this matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not commit myself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to an opinion
whether anything will come of it; this will depend entirely upon your
own exertions; you have had singular advantages hitherto, and your kind
aunt is showing every desire to befriend you, but you must give greater
proof of stability and steadiness of character than you have given yet
if this organ matter is not to prove in the end to be only one disappointment
the more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must insist on two things: firstly that this new iron in
the fire does not distract your attention from your Latin and Greek&rdquo;&mdash;(&ldquo;They
aren&rsquo;t mine,&rdquo; thought Ernest, &ldquo;and never have been&rdquo;)&mdash;&ldquo;and
secondly, that you bring no smell of glue or shavings into the house
here, if you make any part of the organ during your holidays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest was still too young to know how unpleasant a letter he was
receiving.&nbsp; He believed the innuendoes contained in it to be perfectly
just.&nbsp; He knew he was sadly deficient in perseverance.&nbsp; He
liked some things for a little while, and then found he did not like
them any more&mdash;and this was as bad as anything well could be.&nbsp;
His father&rsquo;s letter gave him one of his many fits of melancholy
over his own worthlessness, but the thought of the organ consoled him,
and he felt sure that here at any rate was something to which he could
apply himself steadily without growing tired of it.</p>
<p>It was settled that the organ was not to be begun before the Christmas
holidays were over, and that till then Ernest should do a little plain
carpentering, so as to get to know how to use his tools.&nbsp; Miss
Pontifex had a carpenter&rsquo;s bench set up in an outhouse upon her
own premises, and made terms with the most respectable carpenter in
Roughborough, by which one of his men was to come for a couple of hours
twice a week and set Ernest on the right way; then she discovered she
wanted this or that simple piece of work done, and gave the boy a commission
to do it, paying him handsomely as well as finding him in tools and
materials.&nbsp; She never gave him a syllable of good advice, or talked
to him about everything&rsquo;s depending upon his own exertions, but
she kissed him often, and would come into the workshop and act the part
of one who took an interest in what was being done so cleverly as ere
long to become really interested.</p>
<p>What boy would not take kindly to almost anything with such assistance?&nbsp;
All boys like making things; the exercise of sawing, planing and hammering,
proved exactly what his aunt had wanted to find&mdash;something that
should exercise, but not too much, and at the same time amuse him; when
Ernest&rsquo;s sallow face was flushed with his work, and his eyes were
sparkling with pleasure, he looked quite a different boy from the one
his aunt had taken in hand only a few months earlier.&nbsp; His inner
self never told him that this was humbug, as it did about Latin and
Greek.&nbsp; Making stools and drawers was worth living for, and after
Christmas there loomed the organ, which was scarcely ever absent from
his mind.</p>
<p>His aunt let him invite his friends, encouraging him to bring those
whom her quick sense told her were the most desirable.&nbsp; She smartened
him up also in his personal appearance, always without preaching to
him.&nbsp; Indeed she worked wonders during the short time that was
allowed her, and if her life had been spared I cannot think that my
hero would have come under the shadow of that cloud which cast so heavy
a gloom over his younger manhood; but unfortunately for him his gleam
of sunshine was too hot and too brilliant to last, and he had many a
storm yet to weather, before he became fairly happy.&nbsp; For the present,
however, he was supremely so, and his aunt was happy and grateful for
his happiness, the improvement she saw in him, and his unrepressed affection
for herself.&nbsp; She became fonder of him from day to day in spite
of his many faults and almost incredible foolishnesses.&nbsp; It was
perhaps on account of these very things that she saw how much he had
need of her; but at any rate, from whatever cause, she became strengthened
in her determination to be to him in the place of parents, and to find
in him a son rather than a nephew.&nbsp; But still she made no will.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
<p>All went well for the first part of the following half year.&nbsp;
Miss Pontifex spent the greater part of her holidays in London, and
I also saw her at Roughborough, where I spent a few days, staying at
the &ldquo;Swan.&rdquo;&nbsp; I heard all about my godson in whom, however,
I took less interest than I said I did.&nbsp; I took more interest in
the stage at that time than in anything else, and as for Ernest, I found
him a nuisance for engrossing so much of his aunt&rsquo;s attention,
and taking her so much from London.&nbsp; The organ was begun, and made
fair progress during the first two months of the half year.&nbsp; Ernest
was happier than he had ever been before, and was struggling upwards.&nbsp;
The best boys took more notice of him for his aunt&rsquo;s sake, and
he consorted less with those who led him into mischief.</p>
<p>But much as Miss Pontifex had done, she could not all at once undo
the effect of such surroundings as the boy had had at Battersby.&nbsp;
Much as he feared and disliked his father (though he still knew not
how much this was), he had caught much from him; if Theobald had been
kinder Ernest would have modelled himself upon him entirely, and ere
long would probably have become as thorough a little prig as could have
easily been found.</p>
<p>Fortunately his temper had come to him from his mother, who, when
not frightened, and when there was nothing on the horizon which might
cross the slightest whim of her husband, was an amiable, good-natured
woman.&nbsp; If it was not such an awful thing to say of anyone, I should
say that she meant well.</p>
<p>Ernest had also inherited his mother&rsquo;s love of building castles
in the air, and&mdash;so I suppose it must be called&mdash;her vanity.&nbsp;
He was very fond of showing off, and, provided he could attract attention,
cared little from whom it came, nor what it was for.&nbsp; He caught
up, parrot-like, whatever jargon he heard from his elders, which he
thought was the correct thing, and aired it in season and out of season,
as though it were his own.</p>
<p>Miss Pontifex was old enough and wise enough to know that this is
the way in which even the greatest men as a general rule begin to develop,
and was more pleased with his receptiveness and reproductiveness than
alarmed at the things he caught and reproduced.</p>
<p>She saw that he was much attached to herself, and trusted to this
rather than to anything else.&nbsp; She saw also that his conceit was
not very profound, and that his fits of self-abasement were as extreme
as his exaltation had been.&nbsp; His impulsiveness and sanguine trustfulness
in anyone who smiled pleasantly at him, or indeed was not absolutely
unkind to him, made her more anxious about him than any other point
in his character; she saw clearly that he would have to find himself
rudely undeceived many a time and oft, before he would learn to distinguish
friend from foe within reasonable time.&nbsp; It was her perception
of this which led her to take the action which she was so soon called
upon to take.</p>
<p>Her health was for the most part excellent, and she had never had
a serious illness in her life.&nbsp; One morning, however, soon after
Easter 1850, she awoke feeling seriously unwell.&nbsp; For some little
time there had been a talk of fever in the neighbourhood, but in those
days the precautions that ought to be taken against the spread of infection
were not so well understood as now, and nobody did anything.&nbsp; In
a day or two it became plain that Miss Pontifex had got an attack of
typhoid fever and was dangerously ill.&nbsp; On this she sent off a
messenger to town, and desired him not to return without her lawyer
and myself.</p>
<p>We arrived on the afternoon of the day on which we had been summoned,
and found her still free from delirium: indeed, the cheery way in which
she received us made it difficult to think she could be in danger.&nbsp;
She at once explained her wishes, which had reference, as I expected,
to her nephew, and repeated the substance of what I have already referred
to as her main source of uneasiness concerning him.&nbsp; Then she begged
me by our long and close intimacy, by the suddenness of the danger that
had fallen on her and her powerlessness to avert it, to undertake what
she said she well knew, if she died, would be an unpleasant and invidious
trust.</p>
<p>She wanted to leave the bulk of her money ostensibly to me, but in
reality to her nephew, so that I should hold it in trust for him till
he was twenty-eight years old, but neither he nor anyone else, except
her lawyer and myself, was to know anything about it.&nbsp; She would
leave &pound;5000 in other legacies, and &pound;15,000 to Ernest&mdash;which
by the time he was twenty-eight would have accumulated to, say, &pound;30,000.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sell out the debentures,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;where the money
now is&mdash;and put it into Midland Ordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him make his mistakes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;upon the
money his grandfather left him.&nbsp; I am no prophet, but even I can
see that it will take that boy many years to see things as his neighbours
see them.&nbsp; He will get no help from his father and mother, who
would never forgive him for his good luck if I left him the money outright;
I daresay I am wrong, but I think he will have to lose the greater part
or all of what he has, before he will know how to keep what he will
get from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Supposing he went bankrupt before he was twenty-eight years old,
the money was to be mine absolutely, but she could trust me, she said,
to hand it over to Ernest in due time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I am mistaken, the worst
that can happen is that he will come into a larger sum at twenty-eight
instead of a smaller sum at, say, twenty-three, for I would never trust
him with it earlier, and&mdash;if he knows nothing about it he will
not be unhappy for the want of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She begged me to take &pound;2000 in return for the trouble I should
have in taking charge of the boy&rsquo;s estate, and as a sign of the
testatrix&rsquo;s hope that I would now and again look after him while
he was still young.&nbsp; The remaining &pound;3000 I was to pay in
legacies and annuities to friends and servants.</p>
<p>In vain both her lawyer and myself remonstrated with her on the unusual
and hazardous nature of this arrangement.&nbsp; We told her that sensible
people will not take a more sanguine view concerning human nature than
the Courts of Chancery do.&nbsp; We said, in fact, everything that anyone
else would say.&nbsp; She admitted everything, but urged that her time
was short, that nothing would induce her to leave her money to her nephew
in the usual way.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is an unusually foolish will,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;but he is an unusually foolish boy;&rdquo; and she
smiled quite merrily at her little sally.&nbsp; Like all the rest of
her family, she was very stubborn when her mind was made up.&nbsp; So
the thing was done as she wished it.</p>
<p>No provision was made for either my death or Ernest&rsquo;s&mdash;Miss
Pontifex had settled it that we were neither of us going to die, and
was too ill to go into details; she was so anxious, moreover, to sign
her will while still able to do so that we had practically no alternative
but to do as she told us.&nbsp; If she recovered we could see things
put on a more satisfactory footing, and further discussion would evidently
impair her chances of recovery; it seemed then only too likely that
it was a case of this will or no will at all.</p>
<p>When the will was signed I wrote a letter in duplicate, saying that
I held all Miss Pontifex had left me in trust for Ernest except as regards
&pound;5000, but that he was not to come into the bequest, and was to
know nothing whatever about it directly or indirectly, till he was twenty-eight
years old, and if he was bankrupt before he came into it the money was
to be mine absolutely.&nbsp; At the foot of each letter Miss Pontifex
wrote, &ldquo;The above was my understanding when I made my will,&rdquo;
and then signed her name.&nbsp; The solicitor and his clerk witnessed;
I kept one copy myself and handed the other to Miss Pontifex&rsquo;s
solicitor.</p>
<p>When all this had been done she became more easy in her mind.&nbsp;
She talked principally about her nephew.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scold
him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if he is volatile, and continually takes
things up only to throw them down again.&nbsp; How can he find out his
strength or weakness otherwise?&nbsp; A man&rsquo;s profession,&rdquo;
she said, and here she gave one of her wicked little laughs, &ldquo;is
not like his wife, which he must take once for all, for better for worse,
without proof beforehand.&nbsp; Let him go here and there, and learn
his truest liking by finding out what, after all, he catches himself
turning to most habitually&mdash;then let him stick to this; but I daresay
Ernest will be forty or five and forty before he settles down.&nbsp;
Then all his previous infidelities will work together to him for good
if he is the boy I hope he is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above all,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;do not let him work
up to his full strength, except once or twice in his lifetime; nothing
is well done nor worth doing unless, take it all round, it has come
pretty easily.&nbsp; Theobald and Christina would give him a pinch of
salt and tell him to put it on the tails of the seven deadly virtues;&rdquo;&mdash;here
she laughed again in her old manner at once so mocking and so sweet&mdash;&ldquo;I
think if he likes pancakes he had perhaps better eat them on Shrove
Tuesday, but this is enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; These were the last coherent
words she spoke.&nbsp; From that time she grew continually worse, and
was never free from delirium till her death&mdash;which took place less
than a fortnight afterwards, to the inexpressible grief of those who
knew and loved her.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
<p>Letters had been written to Miss Pontifex&rsquo;s brothers and sisters,
and one and all came post-haste to Roughborough.&nbsp; Before they arrived
the poor lady was already delirious, and for the sake of her own peace
at the last I am half glad she never recovered consciousness.</p>
<p>I had known these people all their lives, as none can know each other
but those who have played together as children; I knew how they had
all of them&mdash;perhaps Theobald least, but all of them more or less&mdash;made
her life a burden to her until the death of her father had made her
her own mistress, and I was displeased at their coming one after the
other to Roughborough, and inquiring whether their sister had recovered
consciousness sufficiently to be able to see them.&nbsp; It was known
that she had sent for me on being taken ill, and that I remained at
Roughborough, and I own I was angered by the mingled air of suspicion,
defiance and inquisitiveness, with which they regarded me.&nbsp; They
would all, except Theobald, I believe have cut me downright if they
had not believed me to know something they wanted to know themselves,
and might have some chance of learning from me&mdash;for it was plain
I had been in some way concerned with the making of their sister&rsquo;s
will.&nbsp; None of them suspected what the ostensible nature of this
would be, but I think they feared Miss Pontifex was about to leave money
for public uses.&nbsp; John said to me in his blandest manner that he
fancied he remembered to have heard his sister say that she thought
of leaving money to found a college for the relief of dramatic authors
in distress; to this I made no rejoinder, and I have no doubt his suspicions
were deepened.</p>
<p>When the end came, I got Miss Pontifex&rsquo;s solicitor to write
and tell her brothers and sisters how she had left her money: they were
not unnaturally furious, and went each to his or her separate home without
attending the funeral, and without paying any attention to myself.&nbsp;
This was perhaps the kindest thing they could have done by me, for their
behaviour made me so angry that I became almost reconciled to Alethea&rsquo;s
will out of pleasure at the anger it had aroused.&nbsp; But for this
I should have felt the will keenly, as having been placed by it in the
position which of all others I had been most anxious to avoid, and as
having saddled me with a very heavy responsibility.&nbsp; Still it was
impossible for me to escape, and I could only let things take their
course.</p>
<p>Miss Pontifex had expressed a wish to be buried at Paleham; in the
course of the next few days I therefore took the body thither.&nbsp;
I had not been to Paleham since the death of my father some six years
earlier.&nbsp; I had often wished to go there, but had shrunk from doing
so though my sister had been two or three times.&nbsp; I could not bear
to see the house which had been my home for so many years of my life
in the hands of strangers; to ring ceremoniously at a bell which I had
never yet pulled except as a boy in jest; to feel that I had nothing
to do with a garden in which I had in childhood gathered so many a nosegay,
and which had seemed my own for many years after I had reached man&rsquo;s
estate; to see the rooms bereft of every familiar feature, and made
so unfamiliar in spite of their familiarity.&nbsp; Had there been any
sufficient reason, I should have taken these things as a matter of course,
and should no doubt have found them much worse in anticipation than
in reality, but as there had been no special reason why I should go
to Paleham I had hitherto avoided doing so.&nbsp; Now, however, my going
was a necessity, and I confess I never felt more subdued than I did
on arriving there with the dead playmate of my childhood.</p>
<p>I found the village more changed than I had expected.&nbsp; The railway
had come there, and a brand new yellow brick station was on the site
of old Mr and Mrs Pontifex&rsquo;s cottage.&nbsp; Nothing but the carpenter&rsquo;s
shop was now standing.&nbsp; I saw many faces I knew, but even in six
years they seemed to have grown wonderfully older.&nbsp; Some of the
very old were dead, and the old were getting very old in their stead.&nbsp;
I felt like the changeling in the fairy story who came back after a
seven years&rsquo; sleep.&nbsp; Everyone seemed glad to see me, though
I had never given them particular cause to be so, and everyone who remembered
old Mr and Mrs Pontifex spoke warmly of them and were pleased at their
granddaughter&rsquo;s wishing to be laid near them.&nbsp; Entering the
churchyard and standing in the twilight of a gusty cloudy evening on
the spot close beside old Mrs Pontifex&rsquo;s grave which I had chosen
for Alethea&rsquo;s, I thought of the many times that she, who would
lie there henceforth, and I, who must surely lie one day in some such
another place though when and where I knew not, had romped over this
very spot as childish lovers together.&nbsp; Next morning I followed
her to the grave, and in due course set up a plain upright slab to her
memory as like as might be to those over the graves of her grandmother
and grandfather.&nbsp; I gave the dates and places of her birth and
death, but added nothing except that this stone was set up by one who
had known and loved her.&nbsp; Knowing how fond she had been of music
I had been half inclined at one time to inscribe a few bars of music,
if I could find any which seemed suitable to her character, but I knew
how much she would have disliked anything singular in connection with
her tombstone and did not do it.</p>
<p>Before, however, I had come to this conclusion, I had thought that
Ernest might be able to help me to the right thing, and had written
to him upon the subject.&nbsp; The following is the answer I received&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dear Godpapa,&mdash;I send you the best bit I
can think of; it is the subject of the last of Handel&rsquo;s six grand
fugues and goes thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>[Music score]</p>
<p>It would do better for a man, especially for an old man who was very
sorry for things, than for a woman, but I cannot think of anything better;
if you do not like it for Aunt Alethea I shall keep it for myself.&mdash;Your
affectionate Godson, ERNEST PONTIFEX.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was this the little lad who could get sweeties for two-pence but
not for two-pence-halfpenny?&nbsp; Dear, dear me, I thought to myself,
how these babes and sucklings do give us the go-by surely.&nbsp; Choosing
his own epitaph at fifteen as for a man who &ldquo;had been very sorry
for things,&rdquo; and such a strain as that&mdash;why it might have
done for Leonardo da Vinci himself.&nbsp; Then I set the boy down as
a conceited young jackanapes, which no doubt he was,&mdash;but so are
a great many other young people of Ernest&rsquo;s age.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
<p>If Theobald and Christina had not been too well pleased when Miss
Pontifex first took Ernest in hand, they were still less so when the
connection between the two was interrupted so prematurely.&nbsp; They
said they had made sure from what their sister had said that she was
going to make Ernest her heir.&nbsp; I do not think she had given them
so much as a hint to this effect.&nbsp; Theobald indeed gave Ernest
to understand that she had done so in a letter which will be given shortly,
but if Theobald wanted to make himself disagreeable, a trifle light
as air would forthwith assume in his imagination whatever form was most
convenient to him.&nbsp; I do not think they had even made up their
minds what Alethea was to do with her money before they knew of her
being at the point of death, and as I have said already, if they had
thought it likely that Ernest would be made heir over their own heads
without their having at any rate a life interest in the bequest, they
would have soon thrown obstacles in the way of further intimacy between
aunt and nephew.</p>
<p>This, however, did not bar their right to feeling aggrieved now that
neither they nor Ernest had taken anything at all, and they could profess
disappointment on their boy&rsquo;s behalf which they would have been
too proud to admit upon their own.&nbsp; In fact, it was only amiable
of them to be disappointed under these circumstances.</p>
<p>Christina said that the will was simply fraudulent, and was convinced
that it could be upset if she and Theobald went the right way to work.&nbsp;
Theobald, she said, should go before the Lord Chancellor, not in full
court but in chambers, where he could explain the whole matter; or,
perhaps it would be even better if she were to go herself&mdash;and
I dare not trust myself to describe the reverie to which this last idea
gave rise.&nbsp; I believe in the end Theobald died, and the Lord Chancellor
(who had become a widower a few weeks earlier) made her an offer, which,
however, she firmly but not ungratefully declined; she should ever,
she said, continue to think of him as a friend&mdash;at this point the
cook came in, saying the butcher had called, and what would she please
to order.</p>
<p>I think Theobald must have had an idea that there was something behind
the bequest to me, but he said nothing about it to Christina.&nbsp;
He was angry and felt wronged, because he could not get at Alethea to
give her a piece of his mind any more than he had been able to get at
his father.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is so mean of people,&rdquo; he exclaimed
to himself, &ldquo;to inflict an injury of this sort, and then shirk
facing those whom they have injured; let us hope that, at any rate,
they and I may meet in Heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; But of this he was doubtful,
for when people had done so great a wrong as this, it was hardly to
be supposed that they would go to Heaven at all&mdash;and as for his
meeting them in another place, the idea never so much as entered his
mind.</p>
<p>One so angry and, of late, so little used to contradiction might
be trusted, however, to avenge himself upon someone, and Theobald had
long since developed the organ, by means of which he might vent spleen
with least risk and greatest satisfaction to himself.&nbsp; This organ,
it may be guessed, was nothing else than Ernest; to Ernest therefore
he proceeded to unburden himself, not personally, but by letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to know,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;that your Aunt
Alethea had given your mother and me to understand that it was her wish
to make you her heir&mdash;in the event, of course, of your conducting
yourself in such a manner as to give her confidence in you; as a matter
of fact, however, she has left you nothing, and the whole of her property
has gone to your godfather, Mr Overton.&nbsp; Your mother and I are
willing to hope that if she had lived longer you would yet have succeeded
in winning her good opinion, but it is too late to think of this now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The carpentering and organ-building must at once be discontinued.&nbsp;
I never believed in the project, and have seen no reason to alter my
original opinion.&nbsp; I am not sorry for your own sake, that it is
to be at an end, nor, I am sure, will you regret it yourself in after
years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few words more as regards your own prospects.&nbsp; You
have, as I believe you know, a small inheritance, which is yours legally
under your grandfather&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; This bequest was made inadvertently,
and, I believe, entirely through a misunderstanding on the lawyer&rsquo;s
part.&nbsp; The bequest was probably intended not to take effect till
after the death of your mother and myself; nevertheless, as the will
is actually worded, it will now be at your command if you live to be
twenty-one years old.&nbsp; From this, however, large deductions must
be made.&nbsp; There will be legacy duty, and I do not know whether
I am not entitled to deduct the expenses of your education and maintenance
from birth to your coming of age; I shall not in all likelihood insist
on this right to the full, if you conduct yourself properly, but a considerable
sum should certainly be deducted, there will therefore remain very little&mdash;say
&pound;1000 or &pound;2000 at the outside, as what will be actually
yours&mdash;but the strictest account shall be rendered you in due time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, let me warn you most seriously, is all that you must
expect from me (even Ernest saw that it was not from Theobald at all)
at any rate till after my death, which for aught any of us know may
be yet many years distant.&nbsp; It is not a large sum, but it is sufficient
if supplemented by steadiness and earnestness of purpose.&nbsp; Your
mother and I gave you the name Ernest, hoping that it would remind you
continually of&mdash;&rdquo; but I really cannot copy more of this effusion.&nbsp;
It was all the same old will-shaking game and came practically to this,
that Ernest was no good, and that if he went on as he was going on now,
he would probably have to go about the streets begging without any shoes
or stockings soon after he had left school, or at any rate, college;
and that he, Theobald, and Christina were almost too good for this world
altogether.</p>
<p>After he had written this Theobald felt quite good-natured, and sent
to the Mrs Thompson of the moment even more soup and wine than her usual
not illiberal allowance.</p>
<p>Ernest was deeply, passionately upset by his father&rsquo;s letter;
to think that even his dear aunt, the one person of his relations whom
he really loved, should have turned against him and thought badly of
him after all.&nbsp; This was the unkindest cut of all.&nbsp; In the
hurry of her illness Miss Pontifex, while thinking only of his welfare,
had omitted to make such small present mention of him as would have
made his father&rsquo;s innuendoes stingless; and her illness being
infectious, she had not seen him after its nature was known.&nbsp; I
myself did not know of Theobald&rsquo;s letter, nor think enough about
my godson to guess what might easily be his state.&nbsp; It was not
till many years afterwards that I found Theobald&rsquo;s letter in the
pocket of an old portfolio which Ernest had used at school, and in which
other old letters and school documents were collected which I have used
in this book.&nbsp; He had forgotten that he had it, but told me when
he saw it that he remembered it as the first thing that made him begin
to rise against his father in a rebellion which he recognised as righteous,
though he dared not openly avow it.&nbsp; Not the least serious thing
was that it would, he feared, be his duty to give up the legacy his
grandfather had left him; for if it was his only through a mistake,
how could he keep it?</p>
<p>During the rest of the half year Ernest was listless and unhappy.&nbsp;
He was very fond of some of his schoolfellows, but afraid of those whom
he believed to be better than himself, and prone to idealise everyone
into being his superior except those who were obviously a good deal
beneath him.&nbsp; He held himself much too cheap, and because he was
without that physical strength and vigour which he so much coveted,
and also because he knew he shirked his lessons, he believed that he
was without anything which could deserve the name of a good quality;
he was naturally bad, and one of those for whom there was no place for
repentance, though he sought it even with tears.&nbsp; So he shrank
out of sight of those whom in his boyish way he idolised, never for
a moment suspecting that he might have capacities to the full as high
as theirs though of a different kind, and fell in more with those who
were reputed of the baser sort, with whom he could at any rate be upon
equal terms.&nbsp; Before the end of the half year he had dropped from
the estate to which he had been raised during his aunt&rsquo;s stay
at Roughborough, and his old dejection, varied, however, with bursts
of conceit rivalling those of his mother, resumed its sway over him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pontifex,&rdquo; said Dr Skinner, who had fallen upon him in
hall one day like a moral landslip, before he had time to escape, &ldquo;do
you never laugh?&nbsp; Do you always look so preternaturally grave?&rdquo;&nbsp;
The doctor had not meant to be unkind, but the boy turned crimson, and
escaped.</p>
<p>There was one place only where he was happy, and that was in the
old church of St Michael, when his friend the organist was practising.&nbsp;
About this time cheap editions of the great oratorios began to appear,
and Ernest got them all as soon as they were published; he would sometimes
sell a school-book to a second-hand dealer, and buy a number or two
of the &ldquo;Messiah,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Creation,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Elijah,&rdquo;
with the proceeds.&nbsp; This was simply cheating his papa and mamma,
but Ernest was falling low again&mdash;or thought he was&mdash;and he
wanted the music much, and the Sallust, or whatever it was, little.&nbsp;
Sometimes the organist would go home, leaving his keys with Ernest,
so that he could play by himself and lock up the organ and the church
in time to get back for calling over.&nbsp; At other times, while his
friend was playing, he would wander round the church, looking at the
monuments and the old stained glass windows, enchanted as regards both
ears and eyes, at once.&nbsp; Once the old rector got hold of him as
he was watching a new window being put in, which the rector had bought
in Germany&mdash;the work, it was supposed, of Albert D&uuml;rer.&nbsp;
He questioned Ernest, and finding that he was fond of music, he said
in his old trembling voice (for he was over eighty), &ldquo;Then you
should have known Dr Burney who wrote the history of music.&nbsp; I
knew him exceedingly well when I was a young man.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
made Ernest&rsquo;s heart beat, for he knew that Dr Burney, when a boy
at school at Chester, used to break bounds that he might watch Handel
smoking his pipe in the Exchange coffee house&mdash;and now he was in
the presence of one who, if he had not seen Handel himself, had at least
seen those who had seen him.</p>
<p>These were oases in his desert, but, as a general rule, the boy looked
thin and pale, and as though he had a secret which depressed him, which
no doubt he had, but for which I cannot blame him.&nbsp; He rose, in
spite of himself, higher in the school, but fell ever into deeper and
deeper disgrace with the masters, and did not gain in the opinion of
those boys about whom he was persuaded that they could assuredly never
know what it was to have a secret weighing upon their minds.&nbsp; This
was what Ernest felt so keenly; he did not much care about the boys
who liked him, and idolised some who kept him as far as possible at
a distance, but this is pretty much the case with all boys everywhere.</p>
<p>At last things reached a crisis, below which they could not very
well go, for at the end of the half year but one after his aunt&rsquo;s
death, Ernest brought back a document in his portmanteau, which Theobald
stigmatised as &ldquo;infamous and outrageous.&rdquo;&nbsp; I need hardly
say I am alluding to his school bill.</p>
<p>This document was always a source of anxiety to Ernest, for it was
gone into with scrupulous care, and he was a good deal cross-examined
about it.&nbsp; He would sometimes &ldquo;write in&rdquo; for articles
necessary for his education, such as a portfolio, or a dictionary, and
sell the same, as I have explained, in order to eke out his pocket money,
probably to buy either music or tobacco.&nbsp; These frauds were sometimes,
as Ernest thought, in imminent danger of being discovered, and it was
a load off his breast when the cross-examination was safely over.&nbsp;
This time Theobald had made a great fuss about the extras, but had grudgingly
passed them; it was another matter, however, with the character and
the moral statistics, with which the bill concluded.</p>
<p>The page on which these details were to be found was as follows:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>
<p>Ernest was thus in disgrace from the beginning of the holidays, but
an incident soon occurred which led him into delinquencies compared
with which all his previous sins were venial.</p>
<p>Among the servants at the Rectory was a remarkably pretty girl named
Ellen.&nbsp; She came from Devonshire, and was the daughter of a fisherman
who had been drowned when she was a child.&nbsp; Her mother set up a
small shop in the village where her husband had lived, and just managed
to make a living.&nbsp; Ellen remained with her till she was fourteen,
when she first went out to service.&nbsp; Four years later, when she
was about eighteen, but so well grown that she might have passed for
twenty, she had been strongly recommended to Christina, who was then
in want of a housemaid, and had now been at Battersby about twelve months.</p>
<p>As I have said the girl was remarkably pretty; she looked the perfection
of health and good temper, indeed there was a serene expression upon
her face which captivated almost all who saw her; she looked as if matters
had always gone well with her and were always going to do so, and as
if no conceivable combination of circumstances could put her for long
together out of temper either with herself or with anyone else.&nbsp;
Her complexion was clear, but high; her eyes were grey and beautifully
shaped; her lips were full and restful, with something of an Egyptian
Sphinx-like character about them.&nbsp; When I learned that she came
from Devonshire I fancied I saw a strain of far away Egyptian blood
in her, for I had heard, though I know not what foundation there was
for the story, that the Egyptians made settlements on the coast of Devonshire
and Cornwall long before the Romans conquered Britain.&nbsp; Her hair
was a rich brown, and her figure&mdash;of about the middle height&mdash;perfect,
but erring if at all on the side of robustness.&nbsp; Altogether she
was one of those girls about whom one is inclined to wonder how they
can remain unmarried a week or a day longer.</p>
<p>Her face (as indeed faces generally are, though I grant they lie
sometimes) was a fair index to her disposition.&nbsp; She was good nature
itself, and everyone in the house, not excluding I believe even Theobald
himself after a fashion, was fond of her.&nbsp; As for Christina she
took the very warmest interest in her, and used to have her into the
dining-room twice a week, and prepare her for confirmation (for by some
accident she had never been confirmed) by explaining to her the geography
of Palestine and the routes taken by St Paul on his various journeys
in Asia Minor.</p>
<p>When Bishop Treadwell did actually come down to Battersby and hold
a confirmation there (Christina had her wish, he slept at Battersby,
and she had a grand dinner party for him, and called him &ldquo;My lord&rdquo;
several times), he was so much struck with her pretty face and modest
demeanour when he laid his hands upon her that he asked Christina about
her.&nbsp; When she replied that Ellen was one of her own servants,
the bishop seemed, so she thought or chose to think, quite pleased that
so pretty a girl should have found so exceptionally good a situation.</p>
<p>Ernest used to get up early during the holidays so that he might
play the piano before breakfast without disturbing his papa and mamma&mdash;or
rather, perhaps, without being disturbed by them.&nbsp; Ellen would
generally be there sweeping the drawing-room floor and dusting while
he was playing, and the boy, who was ready to make friends with most
people, soon became very fond of her.&nbsp; He was not as a general
rule sensitive to the charms of the fair sex, indeed he had hardly been
thrown in with any women except his Aunts Allaby, and his Aunt Alethea,
his mother, his sister Charlotte and Mrs Jay; sometimes also he had
had to take off his hat to the Miss Skinners, and had felt as if he
should sink into the earth on doing so, but his shyness had worn off
with Ellen, and the pair had become fast friends.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was well that Ernest was not at home for very long together,
but as yet his affection though hearty was quite Platonic.&nbsp; He
was not only innocent, but deplorably&mdash;I might even say guiltily&mdash;innocent.&nbsp;
His preference was based upon the fact that Ellen never scolded him,
but was always smiling and good tempered; besides she used to like to
hear him play, and this gave him additional zest in playing.&nbsp; The
morning access to the piano was indeed the one distinct advantage which
the holidays had in Ernest&rsquo;s eyes, for at school he could not
get at a piano except quasi-surreptitiously at the shop of Mr Pearsall,
the music-seller.</p>
<p>On returning this midsummer he was shocked to find his favourite
looking pale and ill.&nbsp; All her good spirits had left her, the roses
had fled from her cheek, and she seemed on the point of going into a
decline.&nbsp; She said she was unhappy about her mother, whose health
was failing, and was afraid she was herself not long for this world.&nbsp;
Christina, of course, noticed the change.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have often
remarked,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that those very fresh-coloured, healthy-looking
girls are the first to break up.&nbsp; I have given her calomel and
James&rsquo;s powders repeatedly, and though she does not like it, I
think I must show her to Dr Martin when he next comes here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, my dear,&rdquo; said Theobald, and so next time
Dr Martin came Ellen was sent for.&nbsp; Dr Martin soon discovered what
would probably have been apparent to Christina herself if she had been
able to conceive of such an ailment in connection with a servant who
lived under the same roof as Theobald and herself&mdash;the purity of
whose married life should have preserved all unmarried people who came
near them from any taint of mischief.</p>
<p>When it was discovered that in three or four months more Ellen would
become a mother, Christina&rsquo;s natural good nature would have prompted
her to deal as leniently with the case as she could, if she had not
been panic-stricken lest any mercy on her and Theobald&rsquo;s part
should be construed into toleration, however partial, of so great a
sin; hereon she dashed off into the conviction that the only thing to
do was to pay Ellen her wages, and pack her off on the instant bag and
baggage out of the house which purity had more especially and particularly
singled out for its abiding city.&nbsp; When she thought of the fearful
contamination which Ellen&rsquo;s continued presence even for a week
would occasion, she could not hesitate.</p>
<p>Then came the question&mdash;horrid thought!&mdash;as to who was
the partner of Ellen&rsquo;s guilt?&nbsp; Was it, could it be, her own
son, her darling Ernest?&nbsp; Ernest was getting a big boy now.&nbsp;
She could excuse any young woman for taking a fancy to him; as for himself,
why she was sure he was behind no young man of his age in appreciation
of the charms of a nice-looking young woman.&nbsp; So long as he was
innocent she did not mind this, but oh, if he were guilty!</p>
<p>She could not bear to think of it, and yet it would be mere cowardice
not to look such a matter in the face&mdash;her hope was in the Lord,
and she was ready to bear cheerfully and make the best of any suffering
He might think fit to lay upon her.&nbsp; That the baby must be either
a boy or girl&mdash;this much, at any rate, was clear.&nbsp; No less
clear was it that the child, if a boy, would resemble Theobald, and
if a girl, herself.&nbsp; Resemblance, whether of body or mind, generally
leaped over a generation.&nbsp; The guilt of the parents must not be
shared by the innocent offspring of shame&mdash;oh! no&mdash;and such
a child as this would be . . . She was off in one of her reveries at
once.</p>
<p>The child was in the act of being consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury
when Theobald came in from a visit in the parish, and was told of the
shocking discovery.</p>
<p>Christina said nothing about Ernest, and I believe was more than
half angry when the blame was laid upon other shoulders.&nbsp; She was
easily consoled, however, and fell back on the double reflection, firstly,
that her son was pure, and secondly, that she was quite sure he would
not have been so had it not been for his religious convictions which
had held him back&mdash;as, of course, it was only to be expected they
would.</p>
<p>Theobald agreed that no time must be lost in paying Ellen her wages
and packing her off.&nbsp; So this was done, and less than two hours
after Dr Martin had entered the house Ellen was sitting beside John
the coachman, with her face muffled up so that it could not be seen,
weeping bitterly as she was being driven to the station.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>
<p>Ernest had been out all the morning, but came in to the yard of the
Rectory from the spinney behind the house just as Ellen&rsquo;s things
were being put into the carriage.&nbsp; He thought it was Ellen whom
he then saw get into the carriage, but as her face had been hidden by
her handkerchief he had not been able to see plainly who it was, and
dismissed the idea as improbable.</p>
<p>He went to the back-kitchen window, at which the cook was standing
peeling the potatoes for dinner, and found her crying bitterly.&nbsp;
Ernest was much distressed, for he liked the cook, and, of course, wanted
to know what all the matter was, who it was that had just gone off in
the pony carriage, and why?&nbsp; The cook told him it was Ellen, but
said that no earthly power should make it cross her lips why it was
she was going away; when, however, Ernest took her <i>au pied de la
lettre</i> and asked no further questions, she told him all about it
after extorting the most solemn promises of secrecy.</p>
<p>It took Ernest some minutes to arrive at the facts of the case, but
when he understood them he leaned against the pump, which stood near
the back-kitchen window, and mingled his tears with the cook&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Then his blood began to boil within him.&nbsp; He did not see that
after all his father and mother could have done much otherwise than
they actually did.&nbsp; They might perhaps have been less precipitate,
and tried to keep the matter a little more quiet, but this would not
have been easy, nor would it have mended things very materially.&nbsp;
The bitter fact remains that if a girl does certain things she must
do them at her peril, no matter how young and pretty she is nor to what
temptation she has succumbed.&nbsp; This is the way of the world, and
as yet there has been no help found for it.</p>
<p>Ernest could only see what he gathered from the cook, namely, that
his favourite, Ellen, was being turned adrift with a matter of three
pounds in her pocket, to go she knew not where, and to do she knew not
what, and that she had said she should hang or drown herself, which
the boy implicitly believed she would.</p>
<p>With greater promptitude than he had shown yet, he reckoned up his
money and found he had two shillings and threepence at his command;
there was his knife which might sell for a shilling, and there was the
silver watch his Aunt Alethea had given him shortly before she died.&nbsp;
The carriage had been gone now a full quarter of an hour, and it must
have got some distance ahead, but he would do his best to catch it up,
and there were short cuts which would perhaps give him a chance.&nbsp;
He was off at once, and from the top of the hill just past the Rectory
paddock he could see the carriage, looking very small, on a bit of road
which showed perhaps a mile and a half in front of him.</p>
<p>One of the most popular amusements at Roughborough was an institution
called &ldquo;the hounds&rdquo;&mdash;more commonly known elsewhere
as &ldquo;hare and hounds,&rdquo; but in this case the hare was a couple
of boys who were called foxes, and boys are so particular about correctness
of nomenclature where their sports are concerned that I dare not say
they played &ldquo;hare and hounds&rdquo;; these were &ldquo;the hounds,&rdquo;
and that was all.&nbsp; Ernest&rsquo;s want of muscular strength did
not tell against him here; there was no jostling up against boys who,
though neither older nor taller than he, were yet more robustly built;
if it came to mere endurance he was as good as any one else, so when
his carpentering was stopped he had naturally taken to &ldquo;the hounds&rdquo;
as his favourite amusement.&nbsp; His lungs thus exercised had become
developed, and as a run of six or seven miles across country was not
more than he was used to, he did not despair by the help of the short
cuts of overtaking the carriage, or at the worst of catching Ellen at
the station before the train left.&nbsp; So he ran and ran and ran till
his first wind was gone and his second came, and he could breathe more
easily.&nbsp; Never with &ldquo;the hounds&rdquo; had he run so fast
and with so few breaks as now, but with all his efforts and the help
of the short cuts he did not catch up the carriage, and would probably
not have done so had not John happened to turn his head and seen him
running and making signs for the carriage to stop a quarter of a mile
off.&nbsp; He was now about five miles from home, and was nearly done
up.</p>
<p>He was crimson with his exertion; covered with dust, and with his
trousers and coat sleeves a trifle short for him he cut a poor figure
enough as he thrust on Ellen his watch, his knife, and the little money
he had.&nbsp; The one thing he implored of her was not to do those dreadful
things which she threatened&mdash;for his sake if for no other reason.</p>
<p>Ellen at first would not hear of taking anything from him, but the
coachman, who was from the north country, sided with Ernest.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take
it, my lass,&rdquo; he said kindly, &ldquo;take what thou canst get
whiles thou canst get it; as for Master Ernest here&mdash;he has run
well after thee; therefore let him give thee what he is minded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen did what she was told, and the two parted with many tears,
the girl&rsquo;s last words being that she should never forget him,
and that they should meet again hereafter, she was sure they should,
and then she would repay him.</p>
<p>Then Ernest got into a field by the roadside, flung himself on the
grass, and waited under the shadow of a hedge till the carriage should
pass on its return from the station and pick him up, for he was dead
beat.&nbsp; Thoughts which had already occurred to him with some force
now came more strongly before him, and he saw that he had got himself
into one mess&mdash;or rather into half-a-dozen messes&mdash;the more.</p>
<p>In the first place he should be late for dinner, and this was one
of the offences on which Theobald had no mercy.&nbsp; Also he should
have to say where he had been, and there was a danger of being found
out if he did not speak the truth.&nbsp; Not only this, but sooner or
later it must come out that he was no longer possessed of the beautiful
watch which his dear aunt had given him&mdash;and what, pray, had he
done with it, or how had he lost it?&nbsp; The reader will know very
well what he ought to have done.&nbsp; He should have gone straight
home, and if questioned should have said, &ldquo;I have been running
after the carriage to catch our housemaid Ellen, whom I am very fond
of; I have given her my watch, my knife and all my pocket money, so
that I have now no pocket money at all and shall probably ask you for
some more sooner than I otherwise might have done, and you will also
have to buy me a new watch and a knife.&rdquo;&nbsp; But then fancy
the consternation which such an announcement would have occasioned!&nbsp;
Fancy the scowl and flashing eyes of the infuriated Theobald!&nbsp;
&ldquo;You unprincipled young scoundrel,&rdquo; he would exclaim, &ldquo;do
you mean to vilify your own parents by implying that they have dealt
harshly by one whose profligacy has disgraced their house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or he might take it with one of those sallies of sarcastic calm,
of which he believed himself to be a master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Ernest, very well: I shall say nothing; you can
please yourself; you are not yet twenty-one, but pray act as if you
were your own master; your poor aunt doubtless gave you the watch that
you might fling it away upon the first improper character you came across;
I think I can now understand, however, why she did not leave you her
money; and, after all, your godfather may just as well have it as the
kind of people on whom you would lavish it if it were yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then his mother would burst into tears and implore him to repent
and seek the things belonging to his peace while there was yet time,
by falling on his knees to Theobald and assuring him of his unfailing
love for him as the kindest and tenderest father in the universe.&nbsp;
Ernest could do all this just as well as they could, and now, as he
lay on the grass, speeches, some one or other of which was as certain
to come as the sun to set, kept running in his head till they confuted
the idea of telling the truth by reducing it to an absurdity.&nbsp;
Truth might be heroic, but it was not within the range of practical
domestic politics.</p>
<p>Having settled then that he was to tell a lie, what lie should he
tell?&nbsp; Should he say he had been robbed?&nbsp; He had enough imagination
to know that he had not enough imagination to carry him out here.&nbsp;
Young as he was, his instinct told him that the best liar is he who
makes the smallest amount of lying go the longest way&mdash;who husbands
it too carefully to waste it where it can be dispensed with.&nbsp; The
simplest course would be to say that he had lost the watch, and was
late for dinner because he had been looking for it.&nbsp; He had been
out for a long walk&mdash;he chose the line across the fields that he
had actually taken&mdash;and the weather being very hot, he had taken
off his coat and waistcoat; in carrying them over his arm his watch,
his money, and his knife had dropped out of them.&nbsp; He had got nearly
home when he found out his loss, and had run back as fast as he could,
looking along the line he had followed, till at last he had given it
up; seeing the carriage coming back from the station, he had let it
pick him up and bring him home.</p>
<p>This covered everything, the running and all; for his face still
showed that he must have been running hard; the only question was whether
he had been seen about the Rectory by any but the servants for a couple
of hours or so before Ellen had gone, and this he was happy to believe
was not the case; for he had been out except during his few minutes&rsquo;
interview with the cook.&nbsp; His father had been out in the parish;
his mother had certainly not come across him, and his brother and sister
had also been out with the governess.&nbsp; He knew he could depend
upon the cook and the other servants&mdash;the coachman would see to
this; on the whole, therefore, both he and the coachman thought the
story as proposed by Ernest would about meet the requirements of the
case.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XL</h2>
<p>When Ernest got home and sneaked in through the back door, he heard
his father&rsquo;s voice in its angriest tones, inquiring whether Master
Ernest had already returned.&nbsp; He felt as Jack must have felt in
the story of Jack and the Bean Stalk, when from the oven in which he
was hidden he heard the ogre ask his wife what young children she had
got for his supper.&nbsp; With much courage, and, as the event proved,
with not less courage than discretion, he took the bull by the horns,
and announced himself at once as having just come in after having met
with a terrible misfortune.&nbsp; Little by little he told his story,
and though Theobald stormed somewhat at his &ldquo;incredible folly
and carelessness,&rdquo; he got off better than he expected.&nbsp; Theobald
and Christina had indeed at first been inclined to connect his absence
from dinner with Ellen&rsquo;s dismissal, but on finding it clear, as
Theobald said&mdash;everything was always clear with Theobald&mdash;that
Ernest had not been in the house all the morning, and could therefore
have known nothing of what had happened, he was acquitted on this account
for once in a way, without a stain upon his character.&nbsp; Perhaps
Theobald was in a good temper; he may have seen from the paper that
morning that his stocks had been rising; it may have been this or twenty
other things, but whatever it was, he did not scold so much as Ernest
had expected, and, seeing the boy look exhausted and believing him to
be much grieved at the loss of his watch, Theobald actually prescribed
a glass of wine after his dinner, which, strange to say, did not choke
him, but made him see things more cheerfully than was usual with him.</p>
<p>That night when he said his prayers, he inserted a few paragraphs
to the effect that he might not be discovered, and that things might
go well with Ellen, but he was anxious and ill at ease.&nbsp; His guilty
conscience pointed out to him a score of weak places in his story, through
any one of which detection might even yet easily enter.&nbsp; Next day
and for many days afterwards he fled when no man was pursuing, and trembled
each time he heard his father&rsquo;s voice calling for him.&nbsp; He
had already so many causes of anxiety that he could stand little more,
and in spite of all his endeavours to look cheerful, even his mother
could see that something was preying upon his mind.&nbsp; Then the idea
returned to her that, after all, her son might not be innocent in the
Ellen matter&mdash;and this was so interesting that she felt bound to
get as near the truth as she could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, my poor, pale-faced, heavy-eyed boy,&rdquo; she
said to him one day in her kindest manner; &ldquo;come and sit down
by me, and we will have a little quiet confidential talk together, will
we not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy went mechanically to the sofa.&nbsp; Whenever his mother
wanted what she called a confidential talk with him she always selected
the sofa as the most suitable ground on which to open her campaign.&nbsp;
All mothers do this; the sofa is to them what the dining-room is to
fathers.&nbsp; In the present case the sofa was particularly well adapted
for a strategic purpose, being an old-fashioned one with a high back,
mattress, bolsters and cushions.&nbsp; Once safely penned into one of
its deep corners, it was like a dentist&rsquo;s chair, not too easy
to get out of again.&nbsp; Here she could get at him better to pull
him about, if this should seem desirable, or if she thought fit to cry
she could bury her head in the sofa cushion and abandon herself to an
agony of grief which seldom failed of its effect.&nbsp; None of her
favourite manoeuvres were so easily adopted in her usual seat, the arm-chair
on the right hand side of the fireplace, and so well did her son know
from his mother&rsquo;s tone that this was going to be a sofa conversation
that he took his place like a lamb as soon as she began to speak and
before she could reach the sofa herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest boy,&rdquo; began his mother, taking hold of his
hand and placing it within her own, &ldquo;promise me never to be afraid
either of your dear papa or of me; promise me this, my dear, as you
love me, promise it to me,&rdquo; and she kissed him again and again
and stroked his hair.&nbsp; But with her other hand she still kept hold
of his; she had got him and she meant to keep him.</p>
<p>The lad hung down his head and promised.&nbsp; What else could he
do?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know there is no one, dear, dear Ernest, who loves you
so much as your papa and I do; no one who watches so carefully over
your interests or who is so anxious to enter into all your little joys
and troubles as we are; but my dearest boy, it grieves me to think sometimes
that you have not that perfect love for and confidence in us which you
ought to have.&nbsp; You know, my darling, that it would be as much
our pleasure as our duty to watch over the development of your moral
and spiritual nature, but alas! you will not let us see your moral and
spiritual nature.&nbsp; At times we are almost inclined to doubt whether
you have a moral and spiritual nature at all.&nbsp; Of your inner life,
my dear, we know nothing beyond such scraps as we can glean in spite
of you, from little things which escape you almost before you know that
you have said them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy winced at this.&nbsp; It made him feel hot and uncomfortable
all over.&nbsp; He knew well how careful he ought to be, and yet, do
what he could, from time to time his forgetfulness of the part betrayed
him into unreserve.&nbsp; His mother saw that he winced, and enjoyed
the scratch she had given him.&nbsp; Had she felt less confident of
victory she had better have foregone the pleasure of touching as it
were the eyes at the end of the snail&rsquo;s horns in order to enjoy
seeing the snail draw them in again&mdash;but she knew that when she
had got him well down into the sofa, and held his hand, she had the
enemy almost absolutely at her mercy, and could do pretty much what
she liked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa does not feel,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;that you
love him with that fulness and unreserve which would prompt you to have
no concealment from him, and to tell him everything freely and fearlessly
as your most loving earthly friend next only to your Heavenly Father.&nbsp;
Perfect love, as we know, casteth out fear: your father loves you perfectly,
my darling, but he does not feel as though you loved him perfectly in
return.&nbsp; If you fear him it is because you do not love him as he
deserves, and I know it sometimes cuts him to the very heart to think
that he has earned from you a deeper and more willing sympathy than
you display towards him.&nbsp; Oh, Ernest, Ernest, do not grieve one
who is so good and noble-hearted by conduct which I can call by no other
name than ingratitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest could never stand being spoken to in this way by his mother:
for he still believed that she loved him, and that he was fond of her
and had a friend in her&mdash;up to a certain point.&nbsp; But his mother
was beginning to come to the end of her tether; she had played the domestic
confidence trick upon him times without number already.&nbsp; Over and
over again had she wheedled from him all she wanted to know, and afterwards
got him into the most horrible scrape by telling the whole to Theobald.&nbsp;
Ernest had remonstrated more than once upon these occasions, and had
pointed out to his mother how disastrous to him his confidences had
been, but Christina had always joined issue with him and showed him
in the clearest possible manner that in each case she had been right,
and that he could not reasonably complain.&nbsp; Generally it was her
conscience that forbade her to be silent, and against this there was
no appeal, for we are all bound to follow the dictates of our conscience.&nbsp;
Ernest used to have to recite a hymn about conscience.&nbsp; It was
to the effect that if you did not pay attention to its voice it would
soon leave off speaking.&nbsp; &ldquo;My mamma&rsquo;s conscience has
not left off speaking,&rdquo; said Ernest to one of his chums at Roughborough;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s always jabbering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a boy has once spoken so disrespectfully as this about his mother&rsquo;s
conscience it is practically all over between him and her.&nbsp; Ernest
through sheer force of habit, of the sofa, and of the return of the
associated ideas, was still so moved by the siren&rsquo;s voice as to
yearn to sail towards her, and fling himself into her arms, but it would
not do; there were other associated ideas that returned also, and the
mangled bones of too many murdered confessions were lying whitening
round the skirts of his mother&rsquo;s dress, to allow him by any possibility
to trust her further.&nbsp; So he hung his head and looked sheepish,
but kept his own counsel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, my dearest,&rdquo; continued his mother, &ldquo;either
that I am mistaken, and that there is nothing on your mind, or that
you will not unburden yourself to me: but oh, Ernest, tell me at least
this much; is there nothing that you repent of, nothing which makes
you unhappy in connection with that miserable girl Ellen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest&rsquo;s heart failed him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am a dead boy now,&rdquo;
he said to himself.&nbsp; He had not the faintest conception what his
mother was driving at, and thought she suspected about the watch; but
he held his ground.</p>
<p>I do not believe he was much more of a coward than his neighbours,
only he did not know that all sensible people are cowards when they
are off their beat, or when they think they are going to be roughly
handled.&nbsp; I believe, that if the truth were known, it would be
found that even the valiant St Michael himself tried hard to shirk his
famous combat with the dragon; he pretended not to see all sorts of
misconduct on the dragon&rsquo;s part; shut his eyes to the eating up
of I do not know how many hundreds of men, women and children whom he
had promised to protect; allowed himself to be publicly insulted a dozen
times over without resenting it; and in the end when even an angel could
stand it no longer he shilly-shallied and temporised an unconscionable
time before he would fix the day and hour for the encounter.&nbsp; As
for the actual combat it was much such another <i>wurra-wurra</i> as
Mrs Allaby had had with the young man who had in the end married her
eldest daughter, till after a time behold, there was the dragon lying
dead, while he was himself alive and not very seriously hurt after all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know what you mean, mamma,&rdquo; exclaimed Ernest
anxiously and more or less hurriedly.&nbsp; His mother construed his
manner into indignation at being suspected, and being rather frightened
herself she turned tail and scuttled off as fast as her tongue could
carry her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I see by your tone that you are
innocent!&nbsp; Oh! oh! how I thank my heavenly Father for this; may
He for His dear Son&rsquo;s sake keep you always pure.&nbsp; Your father,
my dear&rdquo;&mdash;(here she spoke hurriedly but gave him a searching
look) &ldquo;was as pure as a spotless angel when he came to me.&nbsp;
Like him, always be self-denying, truly truthful both in word and deed,
never forgetful whose son and grandson you are, nor of the name we gave
you, of the sacred stream in whose waters your sins were washed out
of you through the blood and blessing of Christ,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>But Ernest cut this&mdash;I will not say short&mdash;but a great
deal shorter than it would have been if Christina had had her say out,
by extricating himself from his mamma&rsquo;s embrace and showing a
clean pair of heels.&nbsp; As he got near the purlieus of the kitchen
(where he was more at ease) he heard his father calling for his mother,
and again his guilty conscience rose against him.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has
found all out now,&rdquo; it cried, &ldquo;and he is going to tell mamma&mdash;this
time I am done for.&rdquo;&nbsp; But there was nothing in it; his father
only wanted the key of the cellaret.&nbsp; Then Ernest slunk off into
a coppice or spinney behind the Rectory paddock, and consoled himself
with a pipe of tobacco.&nbsp; Here in the wood with the summer sun streaming
through the trees and a book and his pipe the boy forgot his cares and
had an interval of that rest without which I verily believe his life
would have been insupportable.</p>
<p>Of course, Ernest was made to look for his lost property, and a reward
was offered for it, but it seemed he had wandered a good deal off the
path, thinking to find a lark&rsquo;s nest, more than once, and looking
for a watch and purse on Battersby piewipes was very like looking for
a needle in a bundle of hay: besides it might have been found and taken
by some tramp, or by a magpie of which there were many in the neighbourhood,
so that after a week or ten days the search was discontinued, and the
unpleasant fact had to be faced that Ernest must have another watch,
another knife, and a small sum of pocket money.</p>
<p>It was only right, however, that Ernest should pay half the cost
of the watch; this should be made easy for him, for it should be deducted
from his pocket money in half-yearly instalments extending over two,
or even it might be three years.&nbsp; In Ernest&rsquo;s own interests,
then, as well as those of his father and mother, it would be well that
the watch should cost as little as possible, so it was resolved to buy
a second-hand one.&nbsp; Nothing was to be said to Ernest, but it was
to be bought, and laid upon his plate as a surprise just before the
holidays were over.&nbsp; Theobald would have to go to the county town
in a few days, and could then find some second-hand watch which would
answer sufficiently well.&nbsp; In the course of time, therefore, Theobald
went, furnished with a long list of household commissions, among which
was the purchase of a watch for Ernest.</p>
<p>Those, as I have said, were always happy times, when Theobald was
away for a whole day certain; the boy was beginning to feel easy in
his mind as though God had heard his prayers, and he was not going to
be found out.&nbsp; Altogether the day had proved an unusually tranquil
one, but, alas! it was not to close as it had begun; the fickle atmosphere
in which he lived was never more likely to breed a storm than after
such an interval of brilliant calm, and when Theobald returned Ernest
had only to look in his face to see that a hurricane was approaching.</p>
<p>Christina saw that something had gone very wrong, and was quite frightened
lest Theobald should have heard of some serious money loss; he did not,
however, at once unbosom himself, but rang the bell and said to the
servant, &ldquo;Tell Master Ernest I wish to speak to him in the dining-room.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLI</h2>
<p>Long before Ernest reached the dining-room his ill-divining soul
had told him that his sin had found him out.&nbsp; What head of a family
ever sends for any of its members into the dining-room if his intentions
are honourable?</p>
<p>When he reached it he found it empty&mdash;his father having been
called away for a few minutes unexpectedly upon some parish business&mdash;and
he was left in the same kind of suspense as people are in after they
have been ushered into their dentist&rsquo;s ante-room.</p>
<p>Of all the rooms in the house he hated the dining-room worst.&nbsp;
It was here that he had had to do his Latin and Greek lessons with his
father.&nbsp; It had a smell of some particular kind of polish or varnish
which was used in polishing the furniture, and neither I nor Ernest
can even now come within range of the smell of this kind of varnish
without our hearts failing us.</p>
<p>Over the chimney-piece there was a veritable old master, one of the
few original pictures which Mr George Pontifex had brought from Italy.&nbsp;
It was supposed to be a Salvator Rosa, and had been bought as a great
bargain.&nbsp; The subject was Elijah or Elisha (whichever it was) being
fed by the ravens in the desert.&nbsp; There were the ravens in the
upper right-hand corner with bread and meat in their beaks and claws,
and there was the prophet in question in the lower left-hand corner
looking longingly up towards them.&nbsp; When Ernest was a very small
boy it had been a constant matter of regret to him that the food which
the ravens carried never actually reached the prophet; he did not understand
the limitation of the painter&rsquo;s art, and wanted the meat and the
prophet to be brought into direct contact.&nbsp; One day, with the help
of some steps which had been left in the room, he had clambered up to
the picture and with a piece of bread and butter traced a greasy line
right across it from the ravens to Elisha&rsquo;s mouth, after which
he had felt more comfortable.</p>
<p>Ernest&rsquo;s mind was drifting back to this youthful escapade when
he heard his father&rsquo;s hand on the door, and in another second
Theobald entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ernest,&rdquo; said he, in an off-hand, rather cheery
manner, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a little matter which I should like you
to explain to me, as I have no doubt you very easily can.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thump, thump, thump, went Ernest&rsquo;s heart against his ribs; but
his father&rsquo;s manner was so much nicer than usual that he began
to think it might be after all only another false alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It had occurred to your mother and myself that we should like
to set you up with a watch again before you went back to school&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said Ernest to himself quite relieved),
&ldquo;and I have been to-day to look out for a second-hand one which
should answer every purpose so long as you&rsquo;re at school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Theobald spoke as if watches had half-a-dozen purposes besides time-keeping,
but he could hardly open his mouth without using one or other of his
tags, and &ldquo;answering every purpose&rdquo; was one of them.</p>
<p>Ernest was breaking out into the usual expressions of gratitude,
when Theobald continued, &ldquo;You are interrupting me,&rdquo; and
Ernest&rsquo;s heart thumped again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are interrupting me, Ernest.&nbsp; I have not yet done.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ernest was instantly dumb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I passed several shops with second-hand watches for sale,
but I saw none of a description and price which pleased me, till at
last I was shown one which had, so the shopman said, been left with
him recently for sale, and which I at once recognised as the one which
had been given you by your Aunt Alethea.&nbsp; Even if I had failed
to recognise it, as perhaps I might have done, I should have identified
it directly it reached my hands, inasmuch as it had &lsquo;E. P., a
present from A. P.&rsquo; engraved upon the inside.&nbsp; I need say
no more to show that this was the very watch which you told your mother
and me that you had dropped out of your pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up to this time Theobald&rsquo;s manner had been studiously calm,
and his words had been uttered slowly, but here he suddenly quickened
and flung off the mask as he added the words, &ldquo;or some such cock
and bull story, which your mother and I were too truthful to disbelieve.&nbsp;
You can guess what must be our feelings now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest felt that this last home-thrust was just.&nbsp; In his less
anxious moments he had thought his papa and mamma &ldquo;green&rdquo;
for the readiness with which they believed him, but he could not deny
that their credulity was a proof of their habitual truthfulness of mind.&nbsp;
In common justice he must own that it was very dreadful for two such
truthful people to have a son as untruthful as he knew himself to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believing that a son of your mother and myself would be incapable
of falsehood I at once assumed that some tramp had picked the watch
up and was now trying to dispose of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This to the best of my belief was not accurate.&nbsp; Theobald&rsquo;s
first assumption had been that it was Ernest who was trying to sell
the watch, and it was an inspiration of the moment to say that his magnanimous
mind had at once conceived the idea of a tramp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may imagine how shocked I was when I discovered that the
watch had been brought for sale by that miserable woman Ellen&rdquo;&mdash;here
Ernest&rsquo;s heart hardened a little, and he felt as near an approach
to an instinct to turn as one so defenceless could be expected to feel;
his father quickly perceived this and continued, &ldquo;who was turned
out of this house in circumstances which I will not pollute your ears
by more particularly describing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put aside the horrid conviction which was beginning to dawn
upon me, and assumed that in the interval between her dismissal and
her leaving this house, she had added theft to her other sin, and having
found your watch in your bedroom had purloined it.&nbsp; It even occurred
to me that you might have missed your watch after the woman was gone,
and, suspecting who had taken it, had run after the carriage in order
to recover it; but when I told the shopman of my suspicions he assured
me that the person who left it with him had declared most solemnly that
it had been given her by her master&rsquo;s son, whose property it was,
and who had a perfect right to dispose of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me further that, thinking the circumstances in which
the watch was offered for sale somewhat suspicious, he had insisted
upon the woman&rsquo;s telling him the whole story of how she came by
it, before he would consent to buy it of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said that at first&mdash;as women of that stamp invariably
do&mdash;she tried prevarication, but on being threatened that she should
at once be given into custody if she did not tell the whole truth, she
described the way in which you had run after the carriage, till as she
said you were black in the face, and insisted on giving her all your
pocket money, your knife and your watch.&nbsp; She added that my coachman
John&mdash;whom I shall instantly discharge&mdash;was witness to the
whole transaction.&nbsp; Now, Ernest, be pleased to tell me whether
this appalling story is true or false?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It never occurred to Ernest to ask his father why he did not hit
a man his own size, or to stop him midway in the story with a remonstrance
against being kicked when he was down.&nbsp; The boy was too much shocked
and shaken to be inventive; he could only drift and stammer out that
the tale was true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I feared,&rdquo; said Theobald, &ldquo;and now, Ernest,
be good enough to ring the bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the bell had been answered, Theobald desired that John should
be sent for, and when John came Theobald calculated the wages due to
him and desired him at once to leave the house.</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s manner was quiet and respectful.&nbsp; He took his dismissal
as a matter of course, for Theobald had hinted enough to make him understand
why he was being discharged, but when he saw Ernest sitting pale and
awe-struck on the edge of his chair against the dining-room wall, a
sudden thought seemed to strike him, and turning to Theobald he said
in a broad northern accent which I will not attempt to reproduce:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, master, I can guess what all this is about&mdash;now
before I goes I want to have a word with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ernest,&rdquo; said Theobald, &ldquo;leave the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Master Ernest, you shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said John, planting
himself against the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, master,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;you may do as you please about me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been a good
servant to you, and I don&rsquo;t mean to say as you&rsquo;ve been a
bad master to me, but I do say that if you bear hardly on Master Ernest
here I have those in the village as &rsquo;ll hear on&rsquo;t and let
me know; and if I do hear on&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll come back and break
every bone in your skin, so there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s breath came and went quickly, as though he would have
been well enough pleased to begin the bone-breaking business at once.&nbsp;
Theobald turned of an ashen colour&mdash;not, as he explained afterwards,
at the idle threats of a detected and angry ruffian, but at such atrocious
insolence from one of his own servants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall leave Master Ernest, John,&rdquo; he rejoined proudly,
&ldquo;to the reproaches of his own conscience.&rdquo;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Thank
God and thank John,&rdquo; thought Ernest.)&nbsp; &ldquo;As for yourself,
I admit that you have been an excellent servant until this unfortunate
business came on, and I shall have much pleasure in giving you a character
if you want one.&nbsp; Have you anything more to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more nor what I have said,&rdquo; said John sullenly, &ldquo;but
what I&rsquo;ve said I means and I&rsquo;ll stick to&mdash;character
or no character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you need not be afraid about your character, John,&rdquo;
said Theobald kindly, &ldquo;and as it is getting late, there can be
no occasion for you to leave the house before to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this there was no reply from John, who retired, packed up his
things, and left the house at once.</p>
<p>When Christina heard what had happened she said she could condone
all except that Theobald should have been subjected to such insolence
from one of his own servants through the misconduct of his son.&nbsp;
Theobald was the bravest man in the whole world, and could easily have
collared the wretch and turned him out of the room, but how far more
dignified, how far nobler had been his reply!&nbsp; How it would tell
in a novel or upon the stage, for though the stage as a whole was immoral,
yet there were doubtless some plays which were improving spectacles.&nbsp;
She could fancy the whole house hushed with excitement at hearing John&rsquo;s
menace, and hardly breathing by reason of their interest and expectation
of the coming answer.&nbsp; Then the actor&mdash;probably the great
and good Mr Macready&mdash;would say, &ldquo;I shall leave Master Ernest,
John, to the reproaches of his own conscience.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh, it was
sublime!&nbsp; What a roar of applause must follow!&nbsp; Then she should
enter herself, and fling her arms about her husband&rsquo;s neck, and
call him her lion-hearted husband.&nbsp; When the curtain dropped, it
would be buzzed about the house that the scene just witnessed had been
drawn from real life, and had actually occurred in the household of
the Rev. Theobald Pontifex, who had married a Miss Allaby, etc., etc.</p>
<p>As regards Ernest the suspicions which had already crossed her mind
were deepened, but she thought it better to leave the matter where it
was.&nbsp; At present she was in a very strong position.&nbsp; Ernest&rsquo;s
official purity was firmly established, but at the same time he had
shown himself so susceptible that she was able to fuse two contradictory
impressions concerning him into a single idea, and consider him as a
kind of Joseph and Don Juan in one.&nbsp; This was what she had wanted
all along, but her vanity being gratified by the possession of such
a son, there was an end of it; the son himself was naught.</p>
<p>No doubt if John had not interfered, Ernest would have had to expiate
his offence with ache, penury and imprisonment.&nbsp; As it was the
boy was &ldquo;to consider himself&rdquo; as undergoing these punishments,
and as suffering pangs of unavailing remorse inflicted on him by his
conscience into the bargain; but beyond the fact that Theobald kept
him more closely to his holiday task, and the continued coldness of
his parents, no ostensible punishment was meted out to him.&nbsp; Ernest,
however, tells me that he looks back upon this as the time when he began
to know that he had a cordial and active dislike for both his parents,
which I suppose means that he was now beginning to be aware that he
was reaching man&rsquo;s estate.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLII</h2>
<p>About a week before he went back to school his father again sent
for him into the dining-room, and told him that he should restore him
his watch, but that he should deduct the sum he had paid for it&mdash;for
he had thought it better to pay a few shillings rather than dispute
the ownership of the watch, seeing that Ernest had undoubtedly given
it to Ellen&mdash;from his pocket money, in payments which should extend
over two half years.&nbsp; He would therefore have to go back to Roughborough
this half year with only five shillings&rsquo; pocket money.&nbsp; If
he wanted more he must earn more merit money.</p>
<p>Ernest was not so careful about money as a pattern boy should be.&nbsp;
He did not say to himself, &ldquo;Now I have got a sovereign which must
last me fifteen weeks, therefore I may spend exactly one shilling and
fourpence in each week&rdquo;&mdash;and spend exactly one and fourpence
in each week accordingly.&nbsp; He ran through his money at about the
same rate as other boys did, being pretty well cleaned out a few days
after he had got back to school.&nbsp; When he had no more money, he
got a little into debt, and when as far in debt as he could see his
way to repaying, he went without luxuries.&nbsp; Immediately he got
any money he would pay his debts; if there was any over he would spend
it; if there was not&mdash;and there seldom was&mdash;he would begin
to go on tick again.</p>
<p>His finance was always based upon the supposition that he should
go back to school with &pound;1 in his pocket&mdash;of which he owed
say a matter of fifteen shillings.&nbsp; There would be five shillings
for sundry school subscriptions&mdash;but when these were paid the weekly
allowance of sixpence given to each boy in hall, his merit money (which
this half he was resolved should come to a good sum) and renewed credit,
would carry him through the half.</p>
<p>The sudden failure of 15/- was disastrous to my hero&rsquo;s scheme
of finance.&nbsp; His face betrayed his emotions so clearly that Theobald
said he was determined &ldquo;to learn the truth at once, and <i>this
time</i> without days and days of falsehood&rdquo; before he reached
it.&nbsp; The melancholy fact was not long in coming out, namely, that
the wretched Ernest added debt to the vices of idleness, falsehood and
possibly&mdash;for it was not impossible&mdash;immorality.</p>
<p>How had he come to get into debt?&nbsp; Did the other boys do so?&nbsp;
Ernest reluctantly admitted that they did.</p>
<p>With what shops did they get into debt?</p>
<p>This was asking too much, Ernest said he didn&rsquo;t know!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ernest, Ernest,&rdquo; exclaimed his mother, who was in
the room, &ldquo;do not so soon a second time presume upon the forbearance
of the tenderest-hearted father in the world.&nbsp; Give time for one
stab to heal before you wound him with another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was all very fine, but what was Ernest to do?&nbsp; How could
he get the school shop-keepers into trouble by owning that they let
some of the boys go on tick with them?&nbsp; There was Mrs Cross, a
good old soul, who used to sell hot rolls and butter for breakfast,
or eggs and toast, or it might be the quarter of a fowl with bread sauce
and mashed potatoes for which she would charge 6d.&nbsp; If she made
a farthing out of the sixpence it was as much as she did.&nbsp; When
the boys would come trooping into her shop after &ldquo;the hounds&rdquo;
how often had not Ernest heard her say to her servant girls, &ldquo;Now
then, you wanches, git some cheers.&rdquo;&nbsp; All the boys were fond
of her, and was he, Ernest, to tell tales about her?&nbsp; It was horrible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look here, Ernest,&rdquo; said his father with his blackest
scowl, &ldquo;I am going to put a stop to this nonsense once for all.&nbsp;
Either take me fully into your confidence, as a son should take a father,
and trust me to deal with this matter as a clergyman and a man of the
world&mdash;or understand distinctly that I shall take the whole story
to Dr Skinner, who, I imagine, will take much sterner measures than
I should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ernest, Ernest,&rdquo; sobbed Christina, &ldquo;be wise
in time, and trust those who have already shown you that they know but
too well how to be forbearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No genuine hero of romance should have hesitated for a moment.&nbsp;
Nothing should have cajoled or frightened him into telling tales out
of school.&nbsp; Ernest thought of his ideal boys: they, he well knew,
would have let their tongues be cut out of them before information could
have been wrung from any word of theirs.&nbsp; But Ernest was not an
ideal boy, and he was not strong enough for his surroundings; I doubt
how far any boy could withstand the moral pressure which was brought
to bear upon him; at any rate he could not do so, and after a little
more writhing he yielded himself a passive prey to the enemy.&nbsp;
He consoled himself with the reflection that his papa had not played
the confidence trick on him quite as often as his mamma had, and that
probably it was better he should tell his father, than that his father
should insist on Dr Skinner&rsquo;s making an inquiry.&nbsp; His papa&rsquo;s
conscience &ldquo;jabbered&rdquo; a good deal, but not as much as his
mamma&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The little fool forgot that he had not given his
father as many chances of betraying him as he had given to Christina.</p>
<p>Then it all came out.&nbsp; He owed this at Mrs Cross&rsquo;s, and
this to Mrs Jones, and this at the &ldquo;Swan and Bottle&rdquo; public
house, to say nothing of another shilling or sixpence or two in other
quarters.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Theobald and Christina were not satiated,
but rather the more they discovered the greater grew their appetite
for discovery; it was their obvious duty to find out everything, for
though they might rescue their own darling from this hotbed of iniquity
without getting to know more than they knew at present, were there not
other papas and mammas with darlings whom also they were bound to rescue
if it were yet possible?&nbsp; What boys, then, owed money to these
harpies as well as Ernest?</p>
<p>Here, again, there was a feeble show of resistance, but the thumbscrews
were instantly applied, and Ernest, demoralised as he already was, recanted
and submitted himself to the powers that were.&nbsp; He told only a
little less than he knew or thought he knew.&nbsp; He was examined,
re-examined, cross-examined, sent to the retirement of his own bedroom
and cross-examined again; the smoking in Mrs Jones&rsquo; kitchen all
came out; which boys smoked and which did not; which boys owed money
and, roughly, how much and where; which boys swore and used bad language.&nbsp;
Theobald was resolved that this time Ernest should, as he called it,
take him into his confidence without reserve, so the school list which
went with Dr Skinner&rsquo;s half-yearly bills was brought out, and
the most secret character of each boy was gone through <i>seriatim</i>
by Mr and Mrs Pontifex, so far as it was in Ernest&rsquo;s power to
give information concerning it, and yet Theobald had on the preceding
Sunday preached a less feeble sermon than he commonly preached, upon
the horrors of the Inquisition.&nbsp; No matter how awful was the depravity
revealed to them, the pair never flinched, but probed and probed, till
they were on the point of reaching subjects more delicate than they
had yet touched upon.&nbsp; Here Ernest&rsquo;s unconscious self took
the matter up and made a resistance to which his conscious self was
unequal, by tumbling him off his chair in a fit of fainting.</p>
<p>Dr Martin was sent for and pronounced the boy to be seriously unwell;
at the same time he prescribed absolute rest and absence from nervous
excitement.&nbsp; So the anxious parents were unwillingly compelled
to be content with what they had got already&mdash;being frightened
into leading him a quiet life for the short remainder of the holidays.&nbsp;
They were not idle, but Satan can find as much mischief for busy hands
as for idle ones, so he sent a little job in the direction of Battersby
which Theobald and Christina undertook immediately.&nbsp; It would be
a pity, they reasoned, that Ernest should leave Roughborough, now that
he had been there three years; it would be difficult to find another
school for him, and to explain why he had left Roughborough.&nbsp; Besides,
Dr Skinner and Theobald were supposed to be old friends, and it would
be unpleasant to offend him; these were all valid reasons for not removing
the boy.&nbsp; The proper thing to do, then, would be to warn Dr Skinner
confidentially of the state of his school, and to furnish him with a
school list annotated with the remarks extracted from Ernest, which
should be appended to the name of each boy.</p>
<p>Theobald was the perfection of neatness; while his son was ill upstairs,
he copied out the school list so that he could throw his comments into
a tabular form, which assumed the following shape&mdash;only that of
course I have changed the names.&nbsp; One cross in each square was
to indicate occasional offence; two stood for frequent, and three for
habitual delinquency.</p>
<pre>          Smoking     Drinking beer    Swearing      Notes
                      at the &ldquo;Swan     and Obscene
                      and Bottle.&rdquo;     Language.
Smith        O            O              XX          Will smoke
                                                     next half
Brown       XXX           O               X
Jones        X            XX              XXX
Robinson    XX            XX              X</pre>
<p>And thus through the whole school.</p>
<p>Of course, in justice to Ernest, Dr Skinner would be bound over to
secrecy before a word was said to him, but, Ernest being thus protected,
he could not be furnished with the facts too completely.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIII</h2>
<p>So important did Theobald consider this matter that he made a special
journey to Roughborough before the half year began.&nbsp; It was a relief
to have him out of the house, but though his destination was not mentioned,
Ernest guessed where he had gone.</p>
<p>To this day he considers his conduct at this crisis to have been
one of the most serious laches of his life&mdash;one which he can never
think of without shame and indignation.&nbsp; He says he ought to have
run away from home.&nbsp; But what good could he have done if he had?&nbsp;
He would have been caught, brought back and examined two days later
instead of two days earlier.&nbsp; A boy of barely sixteen cannot stand
against the moral pressure of a father and mother who have always oppressed
him any more than he can cope physically with a powerful full-grown
man.&nbsp; True, he may allow himself to be killed rather than yield,
but this is being so morbidly heroic as to come close round again to
cowardice; for it is little else than suicide, which is universally
condemned as cowardly.</p>
<p>On the re-assembling of the school it became apparent that something
had gone wrong.&nbsp; Dr Skinner called the boys together, and with
much pomp excommunicated Mrs Cross and Mrs Jones, by declaring their
shops to be out of bounds.&nbsp; The street in which the &ldquo;Swan
and Bottle&rdquo; stood was also forbidden.&nbsp; The vices of drinking
and smoking, therefore, were clearly aimed at, and before prayers Dr
Skinner spoke a few impressive words about the abominable sin of using
bad language.&nbsp; Ernest&rsquo;s feelings can be imagined.</p>
<p>Next day at the hour when the daily punishments were read out, though
there had not yet been time for him to have offended, Ernest Pontifex
was declared to have incurred every punishment which the school provided
for evil-doers.&nbsp; He was placed on the idle list for the whole half
year, and on perpetual detentions; his bounds were curtailed; he was
to attend junior callings-over; in fact he was so hemmed in with punishments
upon every side that it was hardly possible for him to go outside the
school gates.&nbsp; This unparalleled list of punishments inflicted
on the first day of the half year, and intended to last till the ensuing
Christmas holidays, was not connected with any specified offence.&nbsp;
It required no great penetration therefore, on the part of the boys
to connect Ernest with the putting Mrs Cross&rsquo;s and Mrs Jones&rsquo;s
shops out of bounds.</p>
<p>Great indeed was the indignation about Mrs Cross who, it was known,
remembered Dr Skinner himself as a small boy only just got into jackets,
and had doubtless let him have many a sausage and mashed potatoes upon
deferred payment.&nbsp; The head boys assembled in conclave to consider
what steps should be taken, but hardly had they done so before Ernest
knocked timidly at the head-room door and took the bull by the horns
by explaining the facts as far as he could bring himself to do so.&nbsp;
He made a clean breast of everything except about the school list and
the remarks he had made about each boy&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; This
infamy was more than he could own to, and he kept his counsel concerning
it.&nbsp; Fortunately he was safe in doing so, for Dr Skinner, pedant
and more than pedant though he was, had still just sense enough to turn
on Theobald in the matter of the school list.&nbsp; Whether he resented
being told that he did not know the characters of his own boys, or whether
he dreaded a scandal about the school I know not, but when Theobald
had handed him the list, over which he had expended so much pains, Dr
Skinner had cut him uncommonly short, and had then and there, with more
suavity than was usual with him, committed it to the flames before Theobald&rsquo;s
own eyes.</p>
<p>Ernest got off with the head boys easier than he expected.&nbsp;
It was admitted that the offence, heinous though it was, had been committed
under extenuating circumstances; the frankness with which the culprit
had confessed all, his evidently unfeigned remorse, and the fury with
which Dr Skinner was pursuing him tended to bring about a reaction in
his favour, as though he had been more sinned against than sinning.</p>
<p>As the half year wore on his spirits gradually revived, and when
attacked by one of his fits of self-abasement he was in some degree
consoled by having found out that even his father and mother, whom he
had supposed so immaculate, were no better than they should be.&nbsp;
About the fifth of November it was a school custom to meet on a certain
common not far from Roughborough and burn somebody in effigy, this being
the compromise arrived at in the matter of fireworks and Guy Fawkes
festivities.&nbsp; This year it was decided that Pontifex&rsquo;s governor
should be the victim, and Ernest though a good deal exercised in mind
as to what he ought to do, in the end saw no sufficient reason for holding
aloof from proceedings which, as he justly remarked, could not do his
father any harm.</p>
<p>It so happened that the bishop had held a confirmation at the school
on the fifth of November.&nbsp; Dr Skinner had not quite liked the selection
of this day, but the bishop was pressed by many engagements, and had
been compelled to make the arrangement as it then stood.&nbsp; Ernest
was among those who had to be confirmed, and was deeply impressed with
the solemn importance of the ceremony.&nbsp; When he felt the huge old
bishop drawing down upon him as he knelt in chapel he could hardly breathe,
and when the apparition paused before him and laid its hands upon his
head he was frightened almost out of his wits.&nbsp; He felt that he
had arrived at one of the great turning points of his life, and that
the Ernest of the future could resemble only very faintly the Ernest
of the past.</p>
<p>This happened at about noon, but by the one o&rsquo;clock dinner-hour
the effect of the confirmation had worn off, and he saw no reason why
he should forego his annual amusement with the bonfire; so he went with
the others and was very valiant till the image was actually produced
and was about to be burnt; then he felt a little frightened.&nbsp; It
was a poor thing enough, made of paper, calico and straw, but they had
christened it The Rev. Theobald Pontifex, and he had a revulsion of
feeling as he saw it being carried towards the bonfire.&nbsp; Still
he held his ground, and in a few minutes when all was over felt none
the worse for having assisted at a ceremony which, after all, was prompted
by a boyish love of mischief rather than by rancour.</p>
<p>I should say that Ernest had written to his father, and told him
of the unprecedented way in which he was being treated; he even ventured
to suggest that Theobald should interfere for his protection and reminded
him how the story had been got out of him, but Theobald had had enough
of Dr Skinner for the present; the burning of the school list had been
a rebuff which did not encourage him to meddle a second time in the
internal economics of Roughborough.&nbsp; He therefore replied that
he must either remove Ernest from Roughborough altogether, which would
for many reasons be undesirable, or trust to the discretion of the head
master as regards the treatment he might think best for any of his pupils.&nbsp;
Ernest said no more; he still felt that it was so discreditable to him
to have allowed any confession to be wrung from him, that he could not
press the promised amnesty for himself.</p>
<p>It was during the &ldquo;Mother Cross row,&rdquo; as it was long
styled among the boys, that a remarkable phenomenon was witnessed at
Roughborough.&nbsp; I mean that of the head boys under certain conditions
doing errands for their juniors.&nbsp; The head boys had no bounds and
could go to Mrs Cross&rsquo;s whenever they liked; they actually, therefore,
made themselves go-betweens, and would get anything from either Mrs
Cross&rsquo;s or Mrs Jones&rsquo;s for any boy, no matter how low in
the school, between the hours of a quarter to nine and nine in the morning,
and a quarter to six and six in the afternoon.&nbsp; By degrees, however,
the boys grew bolder, and the shops, though not openly declared in bounds
again, were tacitly allowed to be so.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIV</h2>
<p>I may spare the reader more details about my hero&rsquo;s school
days.&nbsp; He rose, always in spite of himself, into the Doctor&rsquo;s
form, and for the last two years or so of his time was among the pr&aelig;postors,
though he never rose into the upper half of them.&nbsp; He did little,
and I think the Doctor rather gave him up as a boy whom he had better
leave to himself, for he rarely made him construe, and he used to send
in his exercises or not, pretty much as he liked.&nbsp; His tacit, unconscious
obstinacy had in time effected more even than a few bold sallies in
the first instance would have done.&nbsp; To the end of his career his
position <i>inter pares</i> was what it had been at the beginning, namely,
among the upper part of the less reputable class&mdash;whether of seniors
or juniors&mdash;rather than among the lower part of the more respectable.</p>
<p>Only once in the whole course of his school life did he get praise
from Dr Skinner for any exercise, and this he has treasured as the best
example of guarded approval which he has ever seen.&nbsp; He had had
to write a copy of Alcaics on &ldquo;The dogs of the monks of St Bernard,&rdquo;
and when the exercise was returned to him he found the Doctor had written
on it: &ldquo;In this copy of Alcaics&mdash;which is still excessively
bad&mdash;I fancy that I can discern some faint symptoms of improvement.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ernest says that if the exercise was any better than usual it must have
been by a fluke, for he is sure that he always liked dogs, especially
St Bernard dogs, far too much to take any pleasure in writing Alcaics
about them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I look back upon it,&rdquo; he said to me but the other
day, with a hearty laugh, &ldquo;I respect myself more for having never
once got the best mark for an exercise than I should do if I had got
it every time it could be got.&nbsp; I am glad nothing could make me
do Latin and Greek verses; I am glad Skinner could never get any moral
influence over me; I am glad I was idle at school, and I am glad my
father overtasked me as a boy&mdash;otherwise, likely enough I should
have acquiesced in the swindle, and might have written as good a copy
of Alcaics about the dogs of the monks of St Bernard as my neighbours,
and yet I don&rsquo;t know, for I remember there was another boy, who
sent in a Latin copy of some sort, but for his own pleasure he wrote
the following&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The dogs of the monks of St Bernard go<br />
To pick little children out of the snow,<br />
And around their necks is the cordial gin<br />
Tied with a little bit of bob-bin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should like to have written that, and I did try, but I couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
I didn&rsquo;t quite like the last line, and tried to mend it, but I
couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I fancied I could see traces of bitterness against the instructors
of his youth in Ernest&rsquo;s manner, and said something to this effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; he replied, still laughing, &ldquo;no more
than St Anthony felt towards the devils who had tempted him, when he
met some of them casually a hundred or a couple of hundred years afterwards.&nbsp;
Of course he knew they were devils, but that was all right enough; there
must be devils.&nbsp; St Anthony probably liked these devils better
than most others, and for old acquaintance sake showed them as much
indulgence as was compatible with decorum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, you know,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;St Anthony tempted
the devils quite as much as they tempted him; for his peculiar sanctity
was a greater temptation to tempt him than they could stand.&nbsp; Strictly
speaking, it was the devils who were the more to be pitied, for they
were led up by St Anthony to be tempted and fell, whereas St Anthony
did not fall.&nbsp; I believe I was a disagreeable and unintelligible
boy, and if ever I meet Skinner there is no one whom I would shake hands
with, or do a good turn to more readily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At home things went on rather better; the Ellen and Mother Cross
rows sank slowly down upon the horizon, and even at home he had quieter
times now that he had become a pr&aelig;postor.&nbsp; Nevertheless the
watchful eye and protecting hand were still ever over him to guard his
comings in and his goings out, and to spy out all his ways.&nbsp; Is
it wonderful that the boy, though always trying to keep up appearances
as though he were cheerful and contented&mdash;and at times actually
being so&mdash;wore often an anxious, jaded look when he thought none
were looking, which told of an almost incessant conflict within?</p>
<p>Doubtless Theobald saw these looks and knew how to interpret them,
but it was his profession to know how to shut his eyes to things that
were inconvenient&mdash;no clergyman could keep his benefice for a month
if he could not do this; besides he had allowed himself for so many
years to say things he ought not to have said, and not to say the things
he ought to have said, that he was little likely to see anything that
he thought it more convenient not to see unless he was made to do so.</p>
<p>It was not much that was wanted.&nbsp; To make no mysteries where
Nature has made none, to bring his conscience under something like reasonable
control, to give Ernest his head a little more, to ask fewer questions,
and to give him pocket money with a desire that it should be spent upon
<i>menus plaisirs</i> . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call that not much indeed,&rdquo; laughed Ernest, as I read
him what I have just written.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why it is the whole duty
of a father, but it is the mystery-making which is the worst evil.&nbsp;
If people would dare to speak to one another unreservedly, there would
be a good deal less sorrow in the world a hundred years hence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To return, however, to Roughborough.&nbsp; On the day of his leaving,
when he was sent for into the library to be shaken hands with, he was
surprised to feel that, though assuredly glad to leave, he did not do
so with any especial grudge against the Doctor rankling in his breast.&nbsp;
He had come to the end of it all, and was still alive, nor, take it
all round, more seriously amiss than other people.&nbsp; Dr Skinner
received him graciously, and was even frolicsome after his own heavy
fashion.&nbsp; Young people are almost always placable, and Ernest felt
as he went away that another such interview would not only have wiped
off all old scores, but have brought him round into the ranks of the
Doctor&rsquo;s admirers and supporters&mdash;among whom it is only fair
to say that the greater number of the more promising boys were found.</p>
<p>Just before saying good-bye the Doctor actually took down a volume
from those shelves which had seemed so awful six years previously, and
gave it to him after having written his name in it, and the words &phi;&iota;&lambda;&iota;&alpha;&sigmaf;
&kappa;&alpha;&iota; &epsilon;&upsilon;&nu;&omicron;&iota;&alpha;&sigmaf;
&chi;&alpha;&rho;&iota;&nu;, which I believe means &ldquo;with all kind
wishes from the donor.&rdquo;&nbsp; The book was one written in Latin
by a German&mdash;Sch&ouml;mann: &ldquo;De comitiis Atheniensibus&rdquo;&mdash;not
exactly light and cheerful reading, but Ernest felt it was high time
he got to understand the Athenian constitution and manner of voting;
he had got them up a great many times already, but had forgotten them
as fast as he had learned them; now, however, that the Doctor had given
him this book, he would master the subject once for all.&nbsp; How strange
it was!&nbsp; He wanted to remember these things very badly; he knew
he did, but he could never retain them; in spite of himself they no
sooner fell upon his mind than they fell off it again, he had such a
dreadful memory; whereas, if anyone played him a piece of music and
told him where it came from, he never forgot that, though he made no
effort to retain it, and was not even conscious of trying to remember
it at all.&nbsp; His mind must be badly formed and he was no good.</p>
<p>Having still a short time to spare, he got the keys of St Michael&rsquo;s
church and went to have a farewell practice upon the organ, which he
could now play fairly well.&nbsp; He walked up and down the aisle for
a while in a meditative mood, and then, settling down to the organ,
played &ldquo;They loathed to drink of the river&rdquo; about six times
over, after which he felt more composed and happier; then, tearing himself
away from the instrument he loved so well, he hurried to the station.</p>
<p>As the train drew out he looked down from a high embankment on to
the little house his aunt had taken, and where it might be said she
had died through her desire to do him a kindness.&nbsp; There were the
two well-known bow windows, out of which he had often stepped to run
across the lawn into the workshop.&nbsp; He reproached himself with
the little gratitude he had shown towards this kind lady&mdash;the only
one of his relations whom he had ever felt as though he could have taken
into his confidence.&nbsp; Dearly as he loved her memory, he was glad
she had not known the scrapes he had got into since she died; perhaps
she might not have forgiven them&mdash;and how awful that would have
been!&nbsp; But then, if she had lived, perhaps many of his ills would
have been spared him.&nbsp; As he mused thus he grew sad again.&nbsp;
Where, where, he asked himself, was it all to end?&nbsp; Was it to be
always sin, shame and sorrow in the future, as it had been in the past,
and the ever-watchful eye and protecting hand of his father laying burdens
on him greater than he could bear&mdash;or was he, too, some day or
another to come to feel that he was fairly well and happy?</p>
<p>There was a gray mist across the sun, so that the eye could bear
its light, and Ernest, while musing as above, was looking right into
the middle of the sun himself, as into the face of one whom he knew
and was fond of.&nbsp; At first his face was grave, but kindly, as of
a tired man who feels that a long task is over; but in a few seconds
the more humorous side of his misfortunes presented itself to him, and
he smiled half reproachfully, half merrily, as thinking how little all
that had happened to him really mattered, and how small were his hardships
as compared with those of most people.&nbsp; Still looking into the
eye of the sun and smiling dreamily, he thought how he had helped to
burn his father in effigy, and his look grew merrier, till at last he
broke out into a laugh.&nbsp; Exactly at this moment the light veil
of cloud parted from the sun, and he was brought to <i>terra firma</i>
by the breaking forth of the sunshine.&nbsp; On this he became aware
that he was being watched attentively by a fellow-traveller opposite
to him, an elderly gentleman with a large head and iron-grey hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My young friend,&rdquo; said he, good-naturedly, &ldquo;you
really must not carry on conversations with people in the sun, while
you are in a public railway carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old gentleman said not another word, but unfolded his <i>Times</i>
and began to read it.&nbsp; As for Ernest, he blushed crimson.&nbsp;
The pair did not speak during the rest of the time they were in the
carriage, but they eyed each other from time to time, so that the face
of each was impressed on the recollection of the other.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLV</h2>
<p>Some people say that their school days were the happiest of their
lives.&nbsp; They may be right, but I always look with suspicion upon
those whom I hear saying this.&nbsp; It is hard enough to know whether
one is happy or unhappy now, and still harder to compare the relative
happiness or unhappiness of different times of one&rsquo;s life; the
utmost that can be said is that we are fairly happy so long as we are
not distinctly aware of being miserable.&nbsp; As I was talking with
Ernest one day not so long since about this, he said he was so happy
now that he was sure he had never been happier, and did not wish to
be so, but that Cambridge was the first place where he had ever been
consciously and continuously happy.</p>
<p>How can any boy fail to feel an ecstasy of pleasure on first finding
himself in rooms which he knows for the next few years are to be his
castle?&nbsp; Here he will not be compelled to turn out of the most
comfortable place as soon as he has ensconced himself in it because
papa or mamma happens to come into the room, and he should give it up
to them.&nbsp; The most cosy chair here is for himself, there is no
one even to share the room with him, or to interfere with his doing
as he likes in it&mdash;smoking included.&nbsp; Why, if such a room
looked out both back and front on to a blank dead wall it would still
be a paradise, how much more then when the view is of some quiet grassy
court or cloister or garden, as from the windows of the greater number
of rooms at Oxford and Cambridge.</p>
<p>Theobald, as an old fellow and tutor of Emmanuel&mdash;at which college
he had entered Ernest&mdash;was able to obtain from the present tutor
a certain preference in the choice of rooms; Ernest&rsquo;s, therefore,
were very pleasant ones, looking out upon the grassy court that is bounded
by the Fellows&rsquo; gardens.</p>
<p>Theobald accompanied him to Cambridge, and was at his best while
doing so.&nbsp; He liked the jaunt, and even he was not without a certain
feeling of pride in having a full-blown son at the University.&nbsp;
Some of the reflected rays of this splendour were allowed to fall upon
Ernest himself.&nbsp; Theobald said he was &ldquo;willing to hope&rdquo;&mdash;this
was one of his tags&mdash;that his son would turn over a new leaf now
that he had left school, and for his own part he was &ldquo;only too
ready&rdquo;&mdash;this was another tag&mdash;to let bygones be bygones.</p>
<p>Ernest, not yet having his name on the books, was able to dine with
his father at the Fellows&rsquo; table of one of the other colleges
on the invitation of an old friend of Theobald&rsquo;s; he there made
acquaintance with sundry of the good things of this life, the very names
of which were new to him, and felt as he ate them that he was now indeed
receiving a liberal education.&nbsp; When at length the time came for
him to go to Emmanuel, where he was to sleep in his new rooms, his father
came with him to the gates and saw him safe into college; a few minutes
more and he found himself alone in a room for which he had a latch-key.</p>
<p>From this time he dated many days which, if not quite unclouded,
were upon the whole very happy ones.&nbsp; I need not however describe
them, as the life of a quiet steady-going undergraduate has been told
in a score of novels better than I can tell it.&nbsp; Some of Ernest&rsquo;s
schoolfellows came up to Cambridge at the same time as himself, and
with these he continued on friendly terms during the whole of his college
career.&nbsp; Other schoolfellows were only a year or two his seniors;
these called on him, and he thus made a sufficiently favourable <i>entr&eacute;e</i>
into college life.&nbsp; A straightforwardness of character that was
stamped upon his face, a love of humour, and a temper which was more
easily appeased than ruffled made up for some awkwardness and want of
<i>savoir faire</i>.&nbsp; He soon became a not unpopular member of
the best set of his year, and though neither capable of becoming, nor
aspiring to become, a leader, was admitted by the leaders as among their
nearer hangers-on.</p>
<p>Of ambition he had at that time not one particle; greatness, or indeed
superiority of any kind, seemed so far off and incomprehensible to him
that the idea of connecting it with himself never crossed his mind.&nbsp;
If he could escape the notice of all those with whom he did not feel
himself <i>en rapport</i>, he conceived that he had triumphed sufficiently.&nbsp;
He did not care about taking a good degree, except that it must be good
enough to keep his father and mother quiet.&nbsp; He did not dream of
being able to get a fellowship; if he had, he would have tried hard
to do so, for he became so fond of Cambridge that he could not bear
the thought of having to leave it; the briefness indeed of the season
during which his present happiness was to last was almost the only thing
that now seriously troubled him.</p>
<p>Having less to attend to in the matter of growing, and having got
his head more free, he took to reading fairly well&mdash;not because
he liked it, but because he was told he ought to do so, and his natural
instinct, like that of all very young men who are good for anything,
was to do as those in authority told him.&nbsp; The intention at Battersby
was (for Dr Skinner had said that Ernest could never get a fellowship)
that he should take a sufficiently good degree to be able to get a tutorship
or mastership in some school preparatory to taking orders.&nbsp; When
he was twenty-one years old his money was to come into his own hands,
and the best thing he could do with it would be to buy the next presentation
to a living, the rector of which was now old, and live on his mastership
or tutorship till the living fell in.&nbsp; He could buy a very good
living for the sum which his grandfather&rsquo;s legacy now amounted
to, for Theobald had never had any serious intention of making deductions
for his son&rsquo;s maintenance and education, and the money had accumulated
till it was now about five thousand pounds; he had only talked about
making deductions in order to stimulate the boy to exertion as far as
possible, by making him think that this was his only chance of escaping
starvation&mdash;or perhaps from pure love of teasing.</p>
<p>When Ernest had a living of &pound;600 or &pound;700 a year with
a house, and not too many parishioners&mdash;why, he might add to his
income by taking pupils, or even keeping a school, and then, say at
thirty, he might marry.&nbsp; It was not easy for Theobald to hit on
any much more sensible plan.&nbsp; He could not get Ernest into business,
for he had no business connections&mdash;besides he did not know what
business meant; he had no interest, again, at the Bar; medicine was
a profession which subjected its students to ordeals and temptations
which these fond parents shrank from on behalf of their boy; he would
be thrown among companions and familiarised with details which might
sully him, and though he might stand, it was &ldquo;only too possible&rdquo;
that he would fall.&nbsp; Besides, ordination was the road which Theobald
knew and understood, and indeed the only road about which he knew anything
at all, so not unnaturally it was the one he chose for Ernest.</p>
<p>The foregoing had been instilled into my hero from earliest boyhood,
much as it had been instilled into Theobald himself, and with the same
result&mdash;the conviction, namely, that he was certainly to be a clergyman,
but that it was a long way off yet, and he supposed it was all right.&nbsp;
As for the duty of reading hard, and taking as good a degree as he could,
this was plain enough, so he set himself to work, as I have said, steadily,
and to the surprise of everyone as well as himself got a college scholarship,
of no great value, but still a scholarship, in his freshman&rsquo;s
term.&nbsp; It is hardly necessary to say that Theobald stuck to the
whole of this money, believing the pocket-money he allowed Ernest to
be sufficient for him, and knowing how dangerous it was for young men
to have money at command.&nbsp; I do not suppose it even occurred to
him to try and remember what he had felt when his father took a like
course in regard to himself.</p>
<p>Ernest&rsquo;s position in this respect was much what it had been
at school except that things were on a larger scale.&nbsp; His tutor&rsquo;s
and cook&rsquo;s bills were paid for him; his father sent him his wine;
over and above this he had &pound;50 a year with which to keep himself
in clothes and all other expenses; this was about the usual thing at
Emmanuel in Ernest&rsquo;s day, though many had much less than this.&nbsp;
Ernest did as he had done at school&mdash;he spent what he could, soon
after he received his money; he then incurred a few modest liabilities,
and then lived penuriously till next term, when he would immediately
pay his debts, and start new ones to much the same extent as those which
he had just got rid of.&nbsp; When he came into his &pound;5000 and
became independent of his father, &pound;15 or &pound;20 served to cover
the whole of his unauthorised expenditure.</p>
<p>He joined the boat club, and was constant in his attendance at the
boats.&nbsp; He still smoked, but never took more wine or beer than
was good for him, except perhaps on the occasion of a boating supper,
but even then he found the consequences unpleasant, and soon learned
how to keep within safe limits.&nbsp; He attended chapel as often as
he was compelled to do so; he communicated two or three times a year,
because his tutor told him he ought to; in fact he set himself to live
soberly and cleanly, as I imagine all his instincts prompted him to
do, and when he fell&mdash;as who that is born of woman can help sometimes
doing?&mdash;it was not till after a sharp tussle with a temptation
that was more than his flesh and blood could stand; then he was very
penitent and would go a fairly long while without sinning again; and
this was how it had always been with him since he had arrived at years
of indiscretion.</p>
<p>Even to the end of his career at Cambridge he was not aware that
he had it in him to do anything, but others had begun to see that he
was not wanting in ability and sometimes told him so.&nbsp; He did not
believe it; indeed he knew very well that if they thought him clever
they were being taken in, but it pleased him to have been able to take
them in, and he tried to do so still further; he was therefore a good
deal on the look-out for cants that he could catch and apply in season,
and might have done himself some mischief thus if he had not been ready
to throw over any cant as soon as he had come across another more nearly
to his fancy; his friends used to say that when he rose he flew like
a snipe, darting several times in various directions before he settled
down to a steady straight flight, but when he had once got into this
he would keep to it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVI</h2>
<p>When he was in his third year a magazine was founded at Cambridge,
the contributions to which were exclusively by undergraduates.&nbsp;
Ernest sent in an essay upon the Greek Drama, which he has declined
to let me reproduce here without his being allowed to re-edit it.&nbsp;
I have therefore been unable to give it in its original form, but when
pruned of its redundancies (and this is all that has been done to it)
it runs as follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I shall not attempt within the limits at my disposal
to make a <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of the rise and progress of the
Greek drama, but will confine myself to considering whether the reputation
enjoyed by the three chief Greek tragedians, &AElig;schylus, Sophocles
and Euripides, is one that will be permanent, or whether they will one
day be held to have been overrated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I ask myself, do I see much that I can easily admire
in Homer, Thucydides, Herodotus, Demosthenes, Aristophanes, Theocritus,
parts of Lucretius, Horace&rsquo;s satires and epistles, to say nothing
of other ancient writers, and yet find myself at once repelled by even
those works of &AElig;schylus, Sophocles and Euripides which are most
generally admired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the first-named writers I am in the hands of men who
feel, if not as I do, still as I can understand their feeling, and as
I am interested to see that they should have felt; with the second I
have so little sympathy that I cannot understand how anyone can ever
have taken any interest in them whatever.&nbsp; Their highest flights
to me are dull, pompous and artificial productions, which, if they were
to appear now for the first time, would, I should think, either fall
dead or be severely handled by the critics.&nbsp; I wish to know whether
it is I who am in fault in this matter, or whether part of the blame
may not rest with the tragedians themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far I wonder did the Athenians genuinely like these poets,
and how far was the applause which was lavished upon them due to fashion
or affectation?&nbsp; How far, in fact, did admiration for the orthodox
tragedians take that place among the Athenians which going to church
does among ourselves?</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a venturesome question considering the verdict now
generally given for over two thousand years, nor should I have permitted
myself to ask it if it had not been suggested to me by one whose reputation
stands as high, and has been sanctioned for as long time as those of
the tragedians themselves, I mean by Aristophanes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Numbers, weight of authority, and time, have conspired to
place Aristophanes on as high a literary pinnacle as any ancient writer,
with the exception perhaps of Homer, but he makes no secret of heartily
hating Euripides and Sophocles, and I strongly suspect only praises
&AElig;schylus that he may run down the other two with greater impunity.&nbsp;
For after all there is no such difference between &AElig;schylus and
his successors as will render the former very good and the latter very
bad; and the thrusts at &AElig;schylus which Aristophanes puts into
the mouth of Euripides go home too well to have been written by an admirer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be observed that while Euripides accuses &AElig;schylus
of being &lsquo;pomp-bundle-worded,&rsquo; which I suppose means bombastic
and given to rodomontade, &AElig;schylus retorts on Euripides that he
is a &lsquo;gossip gleaner, a describer of beggars, and a rag-stitcher,&rsquo;
from which it may be inferred that he was truer to the life of his own
times than &AElig;schylus was.&nbsp; It happens, however, that a faithful
rendering of contemporary life is the very quality which gives its most
permanent interest to any work of fiction, whether in literature or
painting, and it is a not unnatural consequence that while only seven
plays by &AElig;schylus, and the same number by Sophocles, have come
down to us, we have no fewer than nineteen by Euripides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, however, is a digression; the question before us is
whether Aristophanes really liked &AElig;schylus or only pretended to
do so.&nbsp; It must be remembered that the claims of &AElig;schylus,
Sophocles and Euripides, to the foremost place amongst tragedians were
held to be as incontrovertible as those of Dante, Petrarch, Tasso and
Ariosto to be the greatest of Italian poets, are held among the Italians
of to-day.&nbsp; If we can fancy some witty, genial writer, we will
say in Florence, finding himself bored by all the poets I have named,
we can yet believe he would be unwilling to admit that he disliked them
without exception.&nbsp; He would prefer to think he could see something
at any rate in Dante, whom he could idealise more easily, inasmuch as
he was more remote; in order to carry his countrymen the farther with
him, he would endeavour to meet them more than was consistent with his
own instincts.&nbsp; Without some such palliation as admiration for
one, at any rate, of the tragedians, it would be almost as dangerous
for Aristophanes to attack them as it would be for an Englishman now
to say that he did not think very much of the Elizabethan dramatists.&nbsp;
Yet which of us in his heart likes any of the Elizabethan dramatists
except Shakespeare?&nbsp; Are they in reality anything else than literary
Struldbrugs?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I conclude upon the whole that Aristophanes did not like any
of the tragedians; yet no one will deny that this keen, witty, outspoken
writer was as good a judge of literary value, and as able to see any
beauties that the tragic dramas contained as nine-tenths, at any rate,
of ourselves.&nbsp; He had, moreover, the advantage of thoroughly understanding
the standpoint from which the tragedians expected their work to be judged,
and what was his conclusion?&nbsp; Briefly it was little else than this,
that they were a fraud or something very like it.&nbsp; For my own part
I cordially agree with him.&nbsp; I am free to confess that with the
exception perhaps of some of the Psalms of David I know no writings
which seem so little to deserve their reputation.&nbsp; I do not know
that I should particularly mind my sisters reading them, but I will
take good care never to read them myself.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This last bit about the Psalms was awful, and there was a great fight
with the editor as to whether or no it should be allowed to stand.&nbsp;
Ernest himself was frightened at it, but he had once heard someone say
that the Psalms were many of them very poor, and on looking at them
more closely, after he had been told this, he found that there could
hardly be two opinions on the subject.&nbsp; So he caught up the remark
and reproduced it as his own, concluding that these psalms had probably
never been written by David at all, but had got in among the others
by mistake.</p>
<p>The essay, perhaps on account of the passage about the Psalms, created
quite a sensation, and on the whole was well received.&nbsp; Ernest&rsquo;s
friends praised it more highly than it deserved, and he was himself
very proud of it, but he dared not show it at Battersby.&nbsp; He knew
also that he was now at the end of his tether; this was his one idea
(I feel sure he had caught more than half of it from other people),
and now he had not another thing left to write about.&nbsp; He found
himself cursed with a small reputation which seemed to him much bigger
than it was, and a consciousness that he could never keep it up.&nbsp;
Before many days were over he felt his unfortunate essay to be a white
elephant to him, which he must feed by hurrying into all sorts of frantic
attempts to cap his triumph, and, as may be imagined, these attempts
were failures.</p>
<p>He did not understand that if he waited and listened and observed,
another idea of some kind would probably occur to him some day, and
that the development of this would in its turn suggest still further
ones.&nbsp; He did not yet know that the very worst way of getting hold
of ideas is to go hunting expressly after them.&nbsp; The way to get
them is to study something of which one is fond, and to note down whatever
crosses one&rsquo;s mind in reference to it, either during study or
relaxation, in a little note-book kept always in the waistcoat pocket.&nbsp;
Ernest has come to know all about this now, but it took him a long time
to find it out, for this is not the kind of thing that is taught at
schools and universities.</p>
<p>Nor yet did he know that ideas, no less than the living beings in
whose minds they arise, must be begotten by parents not very unlike
themselves, the most original still differing but slightly from the
parents that have given rise to them.&nbsp; Life is like a fugue, everything
must grow out of the subject and there must be nothing new.&nbsp; Nor,
again, did he see how hard it is to say where one idea ends and another
begins, nor yet how closely this is paralleled in the difficulty of
saying where a life begins or ends, or an action or indeed anything,
there being an unity in spite of infinite multitude, and an infinite
multitude in spite of unity.&nbsp; He thought that ideas came into clever
people&rsquo;s heads by a kind of spontaneous germination, without parentage
in the thoughts of others or the course of observation; for as yet he
believed in genius, of which he well knew that he had none, if it was
the fine frenzied thing he thought it was.</p>
<p>Not very long before this he had come of age, and Theobald had handed
him over his money, which amounted now to &pound;5000; it was invested
to bring in 5 per cent and gave him therefore an income of &pound;250
a year.&nbsp; He did not, however, realise the fact (he could realise
nothing so foreign to his experience) that he was independent of his
father till a long time afterwards; nor did Theobald make any difference
in his manner towards him.&nbsp; So strong was the hold which habit
and association held over both father and son, that the one considered
he had as good a right as ever to dictate, and the other that he had
as little right as ever to gainsay.</p>
<p>During his last year at Cambridge he overworked himself through this
very blind deference to his father&rsquo;s wishes, for there was no
reason why he should take more than a poll degree except that his father
laid such stress upon his taking honours.&nbsp; He became so ill, indeed,
that it was doubtful how far he would be able to go in for his degree
at all; but he managed to do so, and when the list came out was found
to be placed higher than either he or anyone else expected, being among
the first three or four senior optimes, and a few weeks later, in the
lower half of the second class of the Classical Tripos.&nbsp; Ill as
he was when he got home, Theobald made him go over all the examination
papers with him, and in fact reproduce as nearly as possible the replies
that he had sent in.&nbsp; So little kick had he in him, and so deep
was the groove into which he had got, that while at home he spent several
hours a day in continuing his classical and mathematical studies as
though he had not yet taken his degree.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVII</h2>
<p>Ernest returned to Cambridge for the May term of 1858, on the plea
of reading for ordination, with which he was now face to face, and much
nearer than he liked.&nbsp; Up to this time, though not religiously
inclined, he had never doubted the truth of anything that had been told
him about Christianity.&nbsp; He had never seen anyone who doubted,
nor read anything that raised a suspicion in his mind as to the historical
character of the miracles recorded in the Old and New Testaments.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that the year 1858 was the last of a term during
which the peace of the Church of England was singularly unbroken.&nbsp;
Between 1844, when &ldquo;Vestiges of Creation&rdquo; appeared, and
1859, when &ldquo;Essays and Reviews&rdquo; marked the commencement
of that storm which raged until many years afterwards, there was not
a single book published in England that caused serious commotion within
the bosom of the Church.&nbsp; Perhaps Buckle&rsquo;s &ldquo;History
of Civilisation&rdquo; and Mill&rsquo;s &ldquo;Liberty&rdquo; were the
most alarming, but they neither of them reached the substratum of the
reading public, and Ernest and his friends were ignorant of their very
existence.&nbsp; The Evangelical movement, with the exception to which
I shall revert presently, had become almost a matter of ancient history.&nbsp;
Tractarianism had subsided into a tenth day&rsquo;s wonder; it was at
work, but it was not noisy.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Vestiges&rdquo; were forgotten
before Ernest went up to Cambridge; the Catholic aggression scare had
lost its terrors; Ritualism was still unknown by the general provincial
public, and the Gorham and Hampden controversies were defunct some years
since; Dissent was not spreading; the Crimean war was the one engrossing
subject, to be followed by the Indian Mutiny and the Franco-Austrian
war.&nbsp; These great events turned men&rsquo;s minds from speculative
subjects, and there was no enemy to the faith which could arouse even
a languid interest.&nbsp; At no time probably since the beginning of
the century could an ordinary observer have detected less sign of coming
disturbance than at that of which I am writing.</p>
<p>I need hardly say that the calm was only on the surface.&nbsp; Older
men, who knew more than undergraduates were likely to do, must have
seen that the wave of scepticism which had already broken over Germany
was setting towards our own shores, nor was it long, indeed, before
it reached them.&nbsp; Ernest had hardly been ordained before three
works in quick succession arrested the attention even of those who paid
least heed to theological controversy.&nbsp; I mean &ldquo;Essays and
Reviews,&rdquo; Charles Darwin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Origin of Species,&rdquo;
and Bishop Colenso&rsquo;s &ldquo;Criticisms on the Pentateuch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, however, is a digression; I must revert to the one phase of
spiritual activity which had any life in it during the time Ernest was
at Cambridge, that is to say, to the remains of the Evangelical awakening
of more than a generation earlier, which was connected with the name
of Simeon.</p>
<p>There were still a good many Simeonites, or as they were more briefly
called &ldquo;Sims,&rdquo; in Ernest&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; Every college
contained some of them, but their headquarters were at Caius, whither
they were attracted by Mr Clayton who was at that time senior tutor,
and among the sizars of St John&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Behind the then chapel of this last-named college, there was a &ldquo;labyrinth&rdquo;
(this was the name it bore) of dingy, tumble-down rooms, tenanted exclusively
by the poorest undergraduates, who were dependent upon sizarships and
scholarships for the means of taking their degrees.&nbsp; To many, even
at St John&rsquo;s, the existence and whereabouts of the labyrinth in
which the sizars chiefly lived was unknown; some men in Ernest&rsquo;s
time, who had rooms in the first court, had never found their way through
the sinuous passage which led to it.</p>
<p>In the labyrinth there dwelt men of all ages, from mere lads to grey-haired
old men who had entered late in life.&nbsp; They were rarely seen except
in hall or chapel or at lecture, where their manners of feeding, praying
and studying, were considered alike objectionable; no one knew whence
they came, whither they went, nor what they did, for they never showed
at cricket or the boats; they were a gloomy, seedy-looking <i>conf&eacute;rie</i>,
who had as little to glory in in clothes and manners as in the flesh
itself.</p>
<p>Ernest and his friends used to consider themselves marvels of economy
for getting on with so little money, but the greater number of dwellers
in the labyrinth would have considered one-half of their expenditure
to be an exceeding measure of affluence, and so doubtless any domestic
tyranny which had been experienced by Ernest was a small thing to what
the average Johnian sizar had had to put up with.</p>
<p>A few would at once emerge on its being found after their first examination
that they were likely to be ornaments to the college; these would win
valuable scholarships that enabled them to live in some degree of comfort,
and would amalgamate with the more studious of those who were in a better
social position, but even these, with few exceptions, were long in shaking
off the uncouthness they brought with them to the University, nor would
their origin cease to be easily recognisable till they had become dons
and tutors.&nbsp; I have seen some of these men attain high position
in the world of politics or science, and yet still retain a look of
labyrinth and Johnian sizarship.</p>
<p>Unprepossessing then, in feature, gait and manners, unkempt and ill-dressed
beyond what can be easily described, these poor fellows formed a class
apart, whose thoughts and ways were not as the thoughts and ways of
Ernest and his friends, and it was among them that Simeonism chiefly
flourished.</p>
<p>Destined most of them for the Church (for in those days &ldquo;holy
orders&rdquo; were seldom heard of), the Simeonites held themselves
to have received a very loud call to the ministry, and were ready to
pinch themselves for years so as to prepare for it by the necessary
theological courses.&nbsp; To most of them the fact of becoming clergymen
would be the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> into a social position from which
they were at present kept out by barriers they well knew to be impassable;
ordination, therefore, opened fields for ambition which made it the
central point in their thoughts, rather than as with Ernest, something
which he supposed would have to be done some day, but about which, as
about dying, he hoped there was no need to trouble himself as yet.</p>
<p>By way of preparing themselves more completely they would have meetings
in one another&rsquo;s rooms for tea and prayer and other spiritual
exercises.&nbsp; Placing themselves under the guidance of a few well-known
tutors they would teach in Sunday Schools, and be instant, in season
and out of season, in imparting spiritual instruction to all whom they
could persuade to listen to them.</p>
<p>But the soil of the more prosperous undergraduates was not suitable
for the seed they tried to sow.&nbsp; The small pieties with which they
larded their discourse, if chance threw them into the company of one
whom they considered worldly, caused nothing but aversion in the minds
of those for whom they were intended.&nbsp; When they distributed tracts,
dropping them by night into good men&rsquo;s letter boxes while they
were asleep, their tracts got burnt, or met with even worse contumely;
they were themselves also treated with the ridicule which they reflected
proudly had been the lot of true followers of Christ in all ages.&nbsp;
Often at their prayer meetings was the passage of St Paul referred to
in which he bids his Corinthian converts note concerning themselves
that they were for the most part neither well-bred nor intellectual
people.&nbsp; They reflected with pride that they too had nothing to
be proud of in these respects, and like St Paul, gloried in the fact
that in the flesh they had not much to glory.</p>
<p>Ernest had several Johnian friends, and came thus to hear about the
Simeonites and to see some of them, who were pointed out to him as they
passed through the courts.&nbsp; They had a repellent attraction for
him; he disliked them, but he could not bring himself to leave them
alone.&nbsp; On one occasion he had gone so far as to parody one of
the tracts they had sent round in the night, and to get a copy dropped
into each of the leading Simeonites&rsquo; boxes.&nbsp; The subject
he had taken was &ldquo;Personal Cleanliness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cleanliness,
he said, was next to godliness; he wished to know on which side it was
to stand, and concluded by exhorting Simeonites to a freer use of the
tub.&nbsp; I cannot commend my hero&rsquo;s humour in this matter; his
tract was not brilliant, but I mention the fact as showing that at this
time he was something of a Saul and took pleasure in persecuting the
elect, not, as I have said, that he had any hankering after scepticism,
but because, like the farmers in his father&rsquo;s village, though
he would not stand seeing the Christian religion made light of, he was
not going to see it taken seriously.&nbsp; Ernest&rsquo;s friends thought
his dislike for Simeonites was due to his being the son of a clergyman
who, it was known, bullied him; it is more likely, however, that it
rose from an unconscious sympathy with them, which, as in St Paul&rsquo;s
case, in the end drew him into the ranks of those whom he had most despised
and hated.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVIII</h2>
<p>Once, recently, when he was down at home after taking his degree,
his mother had had a short conversation with him about his becoming
a clergyman, set on thereto by Theobald, who shrank from the subject
himself.&nbsp; This time it was during a turn taken in the garden, and
not on the sofa&mdash;which was reserved for supreme occasions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, my dearest boy,&rdquo; she said to him, &ldquo;that
papa&rdquo; (she always called Theobald &ldquo;papa&rdquo; when talking
to Ernest) &ldquo;is so anxious you should not go into the Church blindly,
and without fully realising the difficulties of a clergyman&rsquo;s
position.&nbsp; He has considered all of them himself, and has been
shown how small they are, when they are faced boldly, but he wishes
you, too, to feel them as strongly and completely as possible before
committing yourself to irrevocable vows, so that you may never, never
have to regret the step you will have taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the first time Ernest had heard that there were any difficulties,
and he not unnaturally enquired in a vague way after their nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, my dear boy,&rdquo; rejoined Christina, &ldquo;is a
question which I am not fitted to enter upon either by nature or education.&nbsp;
I might easily unsettle your mind without being able to settle it again.&nbsp;
Oh, no!&nbsp; Such questions are far better avoided by women, and, I
should have thought, by men, but papa wished me to speak to you upon
the subject, so that there might be no mistake hereafter, and I have
done so.&nbsp; Now, therefore, you know all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation ended here, so far as this subject was concerned,
and Ernest thought he did know all.&nbsp; His mother would not have
told him he knew all&mdash;not about a matter of that sort&mdash;unless
he actually did know it; well, it did not come to very much; he supposed
there were some difficulties, but his father, who at any rate was an
excellent scholar and a learned man, was probably quite right here,
and he need not trouble himself more about them.&nbsp; So little impression
did the conversation make on him, that it was not till long afterwards
that, happening to remember it, he saw what a piece of sleight of hand
had been practised upon him.&nbsp; Theobald and Christina, however,
were satisfied that they had done their duty by opening their son&rsquo;s
eyes to the difficulties of assenting to all a clergyman must assent
to.&nbsp; This was enough; it was a matter for rejoicing that, though
they had been put so fully and candidly before him, he did not find
them serious.&nbsp; It was not in vain that they had prayed for so many
years to be made &ldquo;<i>truly</i> honest and conscientious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, my dear,&rdquo; resumed Christina, after having disposed
of all the difficulties that might stand in the way of Ernest&rsquo;s
becoming a clergyman, &ldquo;there is another matter on which I should
like to have a talk with you.&nbsp; It is about your sister Charlotte.&nbsp;
You know how clever she is, and what a dear, kind sister she has been
and always will be to yourself and Joey.&nbsp; I wish, my dearest Ernest,
that I saw more chance of her finding a suitable husband than I do at
Battersby, and I sometimes think you might do more than you do to help
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest began to chafe at this, for he had heard it so often, but
he said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, my dear, a brother can do so much for his sister
if he lays himself out to do it.&nbsp; A mother can do very little&mdash;indeed,
it is hardly a mother&rsquo;s place to seek out young men; it is a brother&rsquo;s
place to find a suitable partner for his sister; all that I can do is
to try to make Battersby as attractive as possible to any of your friends
whom you may invite.&nbsp; And in that,&rdquo; she added, with a little
toss of her head, &ldquo;I do not think I have been deficient hitherto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest said he had already at different times asked several of his
friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, but you must admit that they were none of them
exactly the kind of young man whom Charlotte could be expected to take
a fancy to.&nbsp; Indeed, I must own to having been a little disappointed
that you should have yourself chosen any of these as your intimate friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest winced again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never brought down Figgins when you were at Roughborough;
now I should have thought Figgins would have been just the kind of boy
whom you might have asked to come and see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Figgins had been gone through times out of number already.&nbsp;
Ernest had hardly known him, and Figgins, being nearly three years older
than Ernest, had left long before he did.&nbsp; Besides he had not been
a nice boy, and had made himself unpleasant to Ernest in many ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued his mother, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s Towneley.&nbsp;
I have heard you speak of Towneley as having rowed with you in a boat
at Cambridge.&nbsp; I wish, my dear, you would cultivate your acquaintance
with Towneley, and ask him to pay us a visit.&nbsp; The name has an
aristocratic sound, and I think I have heard you say he is an eldest
son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest flushed at the sound of Towneley&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>What had really happened in respect of Ernest&rsquo;s friends was
briefly this.&nbsp; His mother liked to get hold of the names of the
boys and especially of any who were at all intimate with her son; the
more she heard, the more she wanted to know; there was no gorging her
to satiety; she was like a ravenous young cuckoo being fed upon a grass
plot by a water wag-tail, she would swallow all that Ernest could bring
her, and yet be as hungry as before.&nbsp; And she always went to Ernest
for her meals rather than to Joey, for Joey was either more stupid or
more impenetrable&mdash;at any rate she could pump Ernest much the better
of the two.</p>
<p>From time to time an actual live boy had been thrown to her, either
by being caught and brought to Battersby, or by being asked to meet
her if at any time she came to Roughborough.&nbsp; She had generally
made herself agreeable, or fairly agreeable, as long as the boy was
present, but as soon as she got Ernest to herself again she changed
her note.&nbsp; Into whatever form she might throw her criticisms it
came always in the end to this, that his friend was no good, that Ernest
was not much better, and that he should have brought her someone else,
for this one would not do at all.</p>
<p>The more intimate the boy had been or was supposed to be with Ernest
the more he was declared to be naught, till in the end he had hit upon
the plan of saying, concerning any boy whom he particularly liked, that
he was not one of his especial chums, and that indeed he hardly knew
why he had asked him; but he found he only fell on Scylla in trying
to avoid Charybdis, for though the boy was declared to be more successful
it was Ernest who was naught for not thinking more highly of him.</p>
<p>When she had once got hold of a name she never forgot it.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
how is So-and-so?&rdquo; she would exclaim, mentioning some former friend
of Ernest&rsquo;s with whom he had either now quarrelled, or who had
long since proved to be a mere comet and no fixed star at all.&nbsp;
How Ernest wished he had never mentioned So-and-so&rsquo;s name, and
vowed to himself that he would never talk about his friends in future,
but in a few hours he would forget and would prattle away as imprudently
as ever; then his mother would pounce noiselessly on his remarks as
a barn-owl pounces upon a mouse, and would bring them up in a pellet
six months afterwards when they were no longer in harmony with their
surroundings.</p>
<p>Then there was Theobald.&nbsp; If a boy or college friend had been
invited to Battersby, Theobald would lay himself out at first to be
agreeable.&nbsp; He could do this well enough when he liked, and as
regards the outside world he generally did like.&nbsp; His clerical
neighbours, and indeed all his neighbours, respected him yearly more
and more, and would have given Ernest sufficient cause to regret his
imprudence if he had dared to hint that he had anything, however little,
to complain of.&nbsp; Theobald&rsquo;s mind worked in this way: &ldquo;Now,
I know Ernest has told this boy what a disagreeable person I am, and
I will just show him that I am not disagreeable at all, but a good old
fellow, a jolly old boy, in fact a regular old brick, and that it is
Ernest who is in fault all through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he would behave very nicely to the boy at first, and the boy would
be delighted with him, and side with him against Ernest.&nbsp; Of course
if Ernest had got the boy to come to Battersby he wanted him to enjoy
his visit, and was therefore pleased that Theobald should behave so
well, but at the same time he stood so much in need of moral support
that it was painful to him to see one of his own familiar friends go
over to the enemy&rsquo;s camp.&nbsp; For no matter how well we may
know a thing&mdash;how clearly we may see a certain patch of colour,
for example, as red, it shakes us and knocks us about to find another
see it, or be more than half inclined to see it, as green.</p>
<p>Theobald had generally begun to get a little impatient before the
end of the visit, but the impression formed during the earlier part
was the one which the visitor had carried away with him.&nbsp; Theobald
never discussed any of the boys with Ernest.&nbsp; It was Christina
who did this.&nbsp; Theobald let them come, because Christina in a quiet,
persistent way insisted on it; when they did come he behaved, as I have
said, civilly, but he did not like it, whereas Christina did like it
very much; she would have had half Roughborough and half Cambridge to
come and stay at Battersby if she could have managed it, and if it would
not have cost so much money: she liked their coming, so that she might
make a new acquaintance, and she liked tearing them to pieces and flinging
the bits over Ernest as soon as she had had enough of them.</p>
<p>The worst of it was that she had so often proved to be right.&nbsp;
Boys and young men are violent in their affections, but they are seldom
very constant; it is not till they get older that they really know the
kind of friend they want; in their earlier essays young men are simply
learning to judge character.&nbsp; Ernest had been no exception to the
general rule.&nbsp; His swans had one after the other proved to be more
or less geese even in his own estimation, and he was beginning almost
to think that his mother was a better judge of character than he was;
but I think it may be assumed with some certainty that if Ernest had
brought her a real young swan she would have declared it to be the ugliest
and worst goose of all that she had yet seen.</p>
<p>At first he had not suspected that his friends were wanted with a
view to Charlotte; it was understood that Charlotte and they might perhaps
take a fancy for one another; and that would be so very nice, would
it not?&nbsp; But he did not see that there was any deliberate malice
in the arrangement.&nbsp; Now, however, that he had awoke to what it
all meant, he was less inclined to bring any friend of his to Battersby.&nbsp;
It seemed to his silly young mind almost dishonest to ask your friend
to come and see you when all you really meant was &ldquo;Please, marry
my sister.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was like trying to obtain money under false
pretences.&nbsp; If he had been fond of Charlotte it might have been
another matter, but he thought her one of the most disagreeable young
women in the whole circle of his acquaintance.</p>
<p>She was supposed to be very clever.&nbsp; All young ladies are either
very pretty or very clever or very sweet; they may take their choice
as to which category they will go in for, but go in for one of the three
they must.&nbsp; It was hopeless to try and pass Charlotte off as either
pretty or sweet.&nbsp; So she became clever as the only remaining alternative.&nbsp;
Ernest never knew what particular branch of study it was in which she
showed her talent, for she could neither play nor sing nor draw, but
so astute are women that his mother and Charlotte really did persuade
him into thinking that she, Charlotte, had something more akin to true
genius than any other member of the family.&nbsp; Not one, however,
of all the friends whom Ernest had been inveigled into trying to inveigle
had shown the least sign of being so far struck with Charlotte&rsquo;s
commanding powers, as to wish to make them his own, and this may have
had something to do with the rapidity and completeness with which Christina
had dismissed them one after another and had wanted a new one.</p>
<p>And now she wanted Towneley.&nbsp; Ernest had seen this coming and
had tried to avoid it, for he knew how impossible it was for him to
ask Towneley, even if he had wished to do so.</p>
<p>Towneley belonged to one of the most exclusive sets in Cambridge,
and was perhaps the most popular man among the whole number of undergraduates.&nbsp;
He was big and very handsome&mdash;as it seemed to Ernest the handsomest
man whom he ever had seen or ever could see, for it was impossible to
imagine a more lively and agreeable countenance.&nbsp; He was good at
cricket and boating, very good-natured, singularly free from conceit,
not clever but very sensible, and, lastly, his father and mother had
been drowned by the overturning of a boat when he was only two years
old and had left him as their only child and heir to one of the finest
estates in the South of England.&nbsp; Fortune every now and then does
things handsomely by a man all round; Towneley was one of those to whom
she had taken a fancy, and the universal verdict in this case was that
she had chosen wisely.</p>
<p>Ernest had seen Towneley as every one else in the University (except,
of course, dons) had seen him, for he was a man of mark, and being very
susceptible he had liked Towneley even more than most people did, but
at the same time it never so much as entered his head that he should
come to know him.&nbsp; He liked looking at him if he got a chance,
and was very much ashamed of himself for doing so, but there the matter
ended.</p>
<p>By a strange accident, however, during Ernest&rsquo;s last year,
when the names of the crews for the scratch fours were drawn he had
found himself coxswain of a crew, among whom was none other than his
especial hero Towneley; the three others were ordinary mortals, but
they could row fairly well, and the crew on the whole was rather a good
one.</p>
<p>Ernest was frightened out of his wits.&nbsp; When, however, the two
met, he found Towneley no less remarkable for his entire want of anything
like &ldquo;side,&rdquo; and for his power of setting those whom he
came across at their ease, than he was for outward accomplishments;
the only difference he found between Towneley and other people was that
he was so very much easier to get on with.&nbsp; Of course Ernest worshipped
him more and more.</p>
<p>The scratch fours being ended the connection between the two came
to an end, but Towneley never passed Ernest thenceforward without a
nod and a few good-natured words.&nbsp; In an evil moment he had mentioned
Towneley&rsquo;s name at Battersby, and now what was the result?&nbsp;
Here was his mother plaguing him to ask Towneley to come down to Battersby
and marry Charlotte.&nbsp; Why, if he had thought there was the remotest
chance of Towneley&rsquo;s marrying Charlotte he would have gone down
on his knees to him and told him what an odious young woman she was,
and implored him to save himself while there was yet time.</p>
<p>But Ernest had not prayed to be made &ldquo;truly honest and conscientious&rdquo;
for as many years as Christina had.&nbsp; He tried to conceal what he
felt and thought as well as he could, and led the conversation back
to the difficulties which a clergyman might feel to stand in the way
of his being ordained&mdash;not because he had any misgivings, but as
a diversion.&nbsp; His mother, however, thought she had settled all
that, and he got no more out of her.&nbsp; Soon afterwards he found
the means of escaping, and was not slow to avail himself of them.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIX</h2>
<p>On his return to Cambridge in the May term of 1858, Ernest and a
few other friends who were also intended for orders came to the conclusion
that they must now take a more serious view of their position.&nbsp;
They therefore attended chapel more regularly than hitherto, and held
evening meetings of a somewhat furtive character, at which they would
study the New Testament.&nbsp; They even began to commit the Epistles
of St Paul to memory in the original Greek.&nbsp; They got up Beveridge
on the Thirty-nine Articles, and Pearson on the Creed; in their hours
of recreation they read More&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mystery of Godliness,&rdquo;
which Ernest thought was charming, and Taylor&rsquo;s &ldquo;Holy Living
and Dying,&rdquo; which also impressed him deeply, through what he thought
was the splendour of its language.&nbsp; They handed themselves over
to the guidance of Dean Alford&rsquo;s notes on the Greek Testament,
which made Ernest better understand what was meant by &ldquo;difficulties,&rdquo;
but also made him feel how shallow and impotent were the conclusions
arrived at by German neologians, with whose works, being innocent of
German, he was not otherwise acquainted.&nbsp; Some of the friends who
joined him in these pursuits were Johnians, and the meetings were often
held within the walls of St John&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I do not know how tidings of these furtive gatherings had reached
the Simeonites, but they must have come round to them in some way, for
they had not been continued many weeks before a circular was sent to
each of the young men who attended them, informing them that the Rev.
Gideon Hawke, a well-known London Evangelical preacher, whose sermons
were then much talked of, was about to visit his young friend Badcock
of St John&rsquo;s, and would be glad to say a few words to any who
might wish to hear them, in Badcock&rsquo;s rooms on a certain evening
in May.</p>
<p>Badcock was one of the most notorious of all the Simeonites.&nbsp;
Not only was he ugly, dirty, ill-dressed, bumptious, and in every way
objectionable, but he was deformed and waddled when he walked so that
he had won a nick-name which I can only reproduce by calling it &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
my back, and there&rsquo;s my back,&rdquo; because the lower parts of
his back emphasised themselves demonstratively as though about to fly
off in different directions like the two extreme notes in the chord
of the augmented sixth, with every step he took.&nbsp; It may be guessed,
therefore, that the receipt of the circular had for a moment an almost
paralysing effect on those to whom it was addressed, owing to the astonishment
which it occasioned them.&nbsp; It certainly was a daring surprise,
but like so many deformed people, Badcock was forward and hard to check;
he was a pushing fellow to whom the present was just the opportunity
he wanted for carrying war into the enemy&rsquo;s quarters.</p>
<p>Ernest and his friends consulted.&nbsp; Moved by the feeling that
as they were now preparing to be clergymen they ought not to stand so
stiffly on social dignity as heretofore, and also perhaps by the desire
to have a good private view of a preacher who was then much upon the
lips of men, they decided to accept the invitation.&nbsp; When the appointed
time came they went with some confusion and self-abasement to the rooms
of this man, on whom they had looked down hitherto as from an immeasurable
height, and with whom nothing would have made them believe a few weeks
earlier that they could ever come to be on speaking terms.</p>
<p>Mr Hawke was a very different-looking person from Badcock.&nbsp;
He was remarkably handsome, or rather would have been but for the thinness
of his lips, and a look of too great firmness and inflexibility.&nbsp;
His features were a good deal like those of Leonardo da Vinci; moreover
he was kempt, looked in vigorous health, and was of a ruddy countenance.&nbsp;
He was extremely courteous in his manner, and paid a good deal of attention
to Badcock, of whom he seemed to think highly.&nbsp; Altogether our
young friends were taken aback, and inclined to think smaller beer of
themselves and larger of Badcock than was agreeable to the old Adam
who was still alive within them.&nbsp; A few well-known &ldquo;Sims&rdquo;
from St John&rsquo;s and other colleges were present, but not enough
to swamp the Ernest set, as for the sake of brevity, I will call them.</p>
<p>After a preliminary conversation in which there was nothing to offend,
the business of the evening began by Mr Hawke&rsquo;s standing up at
one end of the table, and saying &ldquo;Let us pray.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Ernest set did not like this, but they could not help themselves, so
they knelt down and repeated the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer and a few others
after Mr Hawke, who delivered them remarkably well.&nbsp; Then, when
all had sat down, Mr Hawke addressed them, speaking without notes and
taking for his text the words, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou
me?&rdquo;&nbsp; Whether owing to Mr Hawke&rsquo;s manner, which was
impressive, or to his well-known reputation for ability, or whether
from the fact that each one of the Ernest set knew that he had been
more or less a persecutor of the &ldquo;Sims&rdquo; and yet felt instinctively
that the &ldquo;Sims&rdquo; were after all much more like the early
Christians than he was himself&mdash;at any rate the text, familiar
though it was, went home to the consciences of Ernest and his friends
as it had never yet done.&nbsp; If Mr Hawke had stopped here he would
have almost said enough; as he scanned the faces turned towards him,
and saw the impression he had made, he was perhaps minded to bring his
sermon to an end before beginning it, but if so, he reconsidered himself
and proceeded as follows.&nbsp; I give the sermon in full, for it is
a typical one, and will explain a state of mind which in another generation
or two will seem to stand sadly in need of explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My young friends,&rdquo; said Mr Hawke, &ldquo;I am persuaded
there is not one of you here who doubts the existence of a Personal
God.&nbsp; If there were, it is to him assuredly that I should first
address myself.&nbsp; Should I be mistaken in my belief that all here
assembled accept the existence of a God who is present amongst us though
we see him not, and whose eye is upon our most secret thoughts, let
me implore the doubter to confer with me in private before we part;
I will then put before him considerations through which God has been
mercifully pleased to reveal himself to me, so far as man can understand
him, and which I have found bring peace to the minds of others who have
doubted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assume also that there is none who doubts but that this
God, after whose likeness we have been made, did in the course of time
have pity upon man&rsquo;s blindness, and assume our nature, taking
flesh and coming down and dwelling among us as a man indistinguishable
physically from ourselves.&nbsp; He who made the sun, moon and stars,
the world and all that therein is, came down from Heaven in the person
of his Son, with the express purpose of leading a scorned life, and
dying the most cruel, shameful death which fiendish ingenuity has invented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While on earth he worked many miracles.&nbsp; He gave sight
to the blind, raised the dead to life, fed thousands with a few loaves
and fishes, and was seen to walk upon the waves, but at the end of his
appointed time he died, as was foredetermined, upon the cross, and was
buried by a few faithful friends.&nbsp; Those, however, who had put
him to death set a jealous watch over his tomb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no one, I feel sure, in this room who doubts any
part of the foregoing, but if there is, let me again pray him to confer
with me in private, and I doubt not that by the blessing of God his
doubts will cease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next day but one after our Lord was buried, the tomb being
still jealously guarded by enemies, an angel was seen descending from
Heaven with glittering raiment and a countenance that shone like fire.&nbsp;
This glorious being rolled away the stone from the grave, and our Lord
himself came forth, risen from the dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My young friends, this is no fanciful story like those of
the ancient deities, but a matter of plain history as certain as that
you and I are now here together.&nbsp; If there is one fact better vouched
for than another in the whole range of certainties it is the Resurrection
of Jesus Christ; nor is it less well assured that a few weeks after
he had risen from the dead, our Lord was seen by many hundreds of men
and women to rise amid a host of angels into the air upon a heavenward
journey till the clouds covered him and concealed him from the sight
of men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be said that the truth of these statements has been
denied, but what, let me ask you, has become of the questioners?&nbsp;
Where are they now?&nbsp; Do we see them or hear of them?&nbsp; Have
they been able to hold what little ground they made during the supineness
of the last century?&nbsp; Is there one of your fathers or mothers or
friends who does not see through them?&nbsp; Is there a single teacher
or preacher in this great University who has not examined what these
men had to say, and found it naught?&nbsp; Did you ever meet one of
them, or do you find any of their books securing the respectful attention
of those competent to judge concerning them?&nbsp; I think not; and
I think also you know as well as I do why it is that they have sunk
back into the abyss from which they for a time emerged: it is because
after the most careful and patient examination by the ablest and most
judicial minds of many countries, their arguments were found so untenable
that they themselves renounced them.&nbsp; They fled from the field
routed, dismayed, and suing for peace; nor have they again come to the
front in any civilised country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know these things.&nbsp; Why, then, do I insist upon them?&nbsp;
My dear young friends, your own consciousness will have made the answer
to each one of you already; it is because, though you know so well that
these things did verily and indeed happen, you know also that you have
not realised them to yourselves as it was your duty to do, nor heeded
their momentous, awful import.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now let me go further.&nbsp; You all know that you will
one day come to die, or if not to die&mdash;for there are not wanting
signs which make me hope that the Lord may come again, while some of
us now present are alive&mdash;yet to be changed; for the trumpet shall
sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, for this corruption
must put on incorruption, and this mortal put on immortality, and the
saying shall be brought to pass that is written, &lsquo;Death is swallowed
up in victory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you, or do you not believe that you will one day stand
before the Judgement Seat of Christ?&nbsp; Do you, or do you not believe
that you will have to give an account for every idle word that you have
ever spoken?&nbsp; Do you, or do you not believe that you are called
to live, not according to the will of man, but according to the will
of that Christ who came down from Heaven out of love for you, who suffered
and died for you, who calls you to him, and yearns towards you that
you may take heed even in this your day&mdash;but who, if you heed not,
will also one day judge you, and with whom there is no variableness
nor shadow of turning?</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear young friends, strait is the gate, and narrow is the
way which leadeth to Eternal Life, and few there be that find it.&nbsp;
Few, few, few, for he who will not give up ALL for Christ&rsquo;s sake,
has given up nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you would live in the friendship of this world, if indeed
you are not prepared to give up everything you most fondly cherish,
should the Lord require it of you, then, I say, put the idea of Christ
deliberately on one side at once.&nbsp; Spit upon him, buffet him, crucify
him anew, do anything you like so long as you secure the friendship
of this world while it is still in your power to do so; the pleasures
of this brief life may not be worth paying for by the torments of eternity,
but they are something while they last.&nbsp; If, on the other hand,
you would live in the friendship of God, and be among the number of
those for whom Christ has not died in vain; if, in a word, you value
your eternal welfare, then give up the friendship of this world; of
a surety you must make your choice between God and Mammon, for you cannot
serve both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put these considerations before you, if so homely a term
may be pardoned, as a plain matter of business.&nbsp; There is nothing
low or unworthy in this, as some lately have pretended, for all nature
shows us that there is nothing more acceptable to God than an enlightened
view of our own self-interest; never let anyone delude you here; it
is a simple question of fact; did certain things happen or did they
not?&nbsp; If they did happen, is it reasonable to suppose that you
will make yourselves and others more happy by one course of conduct
or by another?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now let me ask you what answer you have made to this question
hitherto?&nbsp; Whose friendship have you chosen?&nbsp; If, knowing
what you know, you have not yet begun to act according to the immensity
of the knowledge that is in you, then he who builds his house and lays
up his treasure on the edge of a crater of molten lava is a sane, sensible
person in comparison with yourselves.&nbsp; I say this as no figure
of speech or bugbear with which to frighten you, but as an unvarnished
unexaggerated statement which will be no more disputed by yourselves
than by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now Mr Hawke, who up to this time had spoken with singular quietness,
changed his manner to one of greater warmth and continued&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! my young friends turn, turn, turn, now while it is called
to-day&mdash;now from this hour, from this instant; stay not even to
gird up your loins; look not behind you for a second, but fly into the
bosom of that Christ who is to be found of all who seek him, and from
that fearful wrath of God which lieth in wait for those who know not
the things belonging to their peace.&nbsp; For the Son of Man cometh
as a thief in the night, and there is not one of us can tell but what
this day his soul may be required of him.&nbsp; If there is even one
here who has heeded me,&rdquo;&mdash;and he let his eye fall for an
instant upon almost all his hearers, but especially on the Ernest set&mdash;&ldquo;I
shall know that it was not for nothing that I felt the call of the Lord,
and heard as I thought a voice by night that bade me come hither quickly,
for there was a chosen vessel who had need of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Mr Hawke ended rather abruptly; his earnest manner, striking
countenance and excellent delivery had produced an effect greater than
the actual words I have given can convey to the reader; the virtue lay
in the man more than in what he said; as for the last few mysterious
words about his having heard a voice by night, their effect was magical;
there was not one who did not look down to the ground, nor who in his
heart did not half believe that he was the chosen vessel on whose especial
behalf God had sent Mr Hawke to Cambridge.&nbsp; Even if this were not
so, each one of them felt that he was now for the first time in the
actual presence of one who had had a direct communication from the Almighty,
and they were thus suddenly brought a hundredfold nearer to the New
Testament miracles.&nbsp; They were amazed, not to say scared, and as
though by tacit consent they gathered together, thanked Mr Hawke for
his sermon, said good-night in a humble deferential manner to Badcock
and the other Simeonites, and left the room together.&nbsp; They had
heard nothing but what they had been hearing all their lives; how was
it, then, that they were so dumbfoundered by it?&nbsp; I suppose partly
because they had lately begun to think more seriously, and were in a
fit state to be impressed, partly from the greater directness with which
each felt himself addressed, through the sermon being delivered in a
room, and partly to the logical consistency, freedom from exaggeration,
and profound air of conviction with which Mr Hawke had spoken.&nbsp;
His simplicity and obvious earnestness had impressed them even before
he had alluded to his special mission, but this clenched everything,
and the words &ldquo;Lord, is it I?&rdquo; were upon the hearts of each
as they walked pensively home through moonlit courts and cloisters.</p>
<p>I do not know what passed among the Simeonites after the Ernest set
had left them, but they would have been more than mortal if they had
not been a good deal elated with the results of the evening.&nbsp; Why,
one of Ernest&rsquo;s friends was in the University eleven, and he had
actually been in Badcock&rsquo;s rooms and had slunk off on saying good-night
as meekly as any of them.&nbsp; It was no small thing to have scored
a success like this.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER L</h2>
<p>Ernest felt now that the turning point of his life had come.&nbsp;
He would give up all for Christ&mdash;even his tobacco.</p>
<p>So he gathered together his pipes and pouches, and locked them up
in his portmanteau under his bed where they should be out of sight,
and as much out of mind as possible.&nbsp; He did not burn them, because
someone might come in who wanted to smoke, and though he might abridge
his own liberty, yet, as smoking was not a sin, there was no reason
why he should be hard on other people.</p>
<p>After breakfast he left his rooms to call on a man named Dawson,
who had been one of Mr Hawke&rsquo;s hearers on the preceding evening,
and who was reading for ordination at the forthcoming Ember Weeks, now
only four months distant.&nbsp; This man had been always of a rather
serious turn of mind&mdash;a little too much so for Ernest&rsquo;s taste;
but times had changed, and Dawson&rsquo;s undoubted sincerity seemed
to render him a fitting counsellor for Ernest at the present time.&nbsp;
As he was going through the first court of John&rsquo;s on his way to
Dawson&rsquo;s rooms, he met Badcock, and greeted him with some deference.&nbsp;
His advance was received with one of those ecstatic gleams which shone
occasionally upon the face of Badcock, and which, if Ernest had known
more, would have reminded him of Robespierre.&nbsp; As it was, he saw
it and unconsciously recognised the unrest and self-seekingness of the
man, but could not yet formulate them; he disliked Badcock more than
ever, but as he was going to profit by the spiritual benefits which
he had put in his way, he was bound to be civil to him, and civil he
therefore was.</p>
<p>Badcock told him that Mr Hawke had returned to town immediately his
discourse was over, but that before doing so he had enquired particularly
who Ernest and two or three others were.&nbsp; I believe each one of
Ernest&rsquo;s friends was given to understand that he had been more
or less particularly enquired after.&nbsp; Ernest&rsquo;s vanity&mdash;for
he was his mother&rsquo;s son&mdash;was tickled at this; the idea again
presented itself to him that he might be the one for whose benefit Mr
Hawke had been sent.&nbsp; There was something, too, in Badcock&rsquo;s
manner which conveyed the idea that he could say more if he chose, but
had been enjoined to silence.</p>
<p>On reaching Dawson&rsquo;s rooms, he found his friend in raptures
over the discourse of the preceding evening.&nbsp; Hardly less delighted
was he with the effect it had produced on Ernest.&nbsp; He had always
known, he said, that Ernest would come round; he had been sure of it,
but he had hardly expected the conversion to be so sudden.&nbsp; Ernest
said no more had he, but now that he saw his duty so clearly he would
get ordained as soon as possible, and take a curacy, even though the
doing so would make him have to go down from Cambridge earlier, which
would be a great grief to him.&nbsp; Dawson applauded this determination,
and it was arranged that as Ernest was still more or less of a weak
brother, Dawson should take him, so to speak, in spiritual tow for a
while, and strengthen and confirm his faith.</p>
<p>An offensive and defensive alliance therefore was struck up between
this pair (who were in reality singularly ill assorted), and Ernest
set to work to master the books on which the Bishop would examine him.&nbsp;
Others gradually joined them till they formed a small set or church
(for these are the same things), and the effect of Mr Hawke&rsquo;s
sermon instead of wearing off in a few days, as might have been expected,
became more and more marked, so much so that it was necessary for Ernest&rsquo;s
friends to hold him back rather than urge him on, for he seemed likely
to develop&mdash;as indeed he did for a time&mdash;into a religious
enthusiast.</p>
<p>In one matter only, did he openly backslide.&nbsp; He had, as I said
above, locked up his pipes and tobacco, so that he might not be tempted
to use them.&nbsp; All day long on the day after Mr Hawke&rsquo;s sermon
he let them lie in his portmanteau bravely; but this was not very difficult,
as he had for some time given up smoking till after hall.&nbsp; After
hall this day he did not smoke till chapel time, and then went to chapel
in self-defence.&nbsp; When he returned he determined to look at the
matter from a common sense point of view.&nbsp; On this he saw that,
provided tobacco did not injure his health&mdash;and he really could
not see that it did&mdash;it stood much on the same footing as tea or
coffee.</p>
<p>Tobacco had nowhere been forbidden in the Bible, but then it had
not yet been discovered, and had probably only escaped proscription
for this reason.&nbsp; We can conceive of St Paul or even our Lord Himself
as drinking a cup of tea, but we cannot imagine either of them as smoking
a cigarette or a churchwarden.&nbsp; Ernest could not deny this, and
admitted that Paul would almost certainly have condemned tobacco in
good round terms if he had known of its existence.&nbsp; Was it not
then taking rather a mean advantage of the Apostle to stand on his not
having actually forbidden it?&nbsp; On the other hand, it was possible
that God knew Paul would have forbidden smoking, and had purposely arranged
the discovery of tobacco for a period at which Paul should be no longer
living.&nbsp; This might seem rather hard on Paul, considering all he
had done for Christianity, but it would be made up to him in other ways.</p>
<p>These reflections satisfied Ernest that on the whole he had better
smoke, so he sneaked to his portmanteau and brought out his pipes and
tobacco again.&nbsp; There should be moderation he felt in all things,
even in virtue; so for that night he smoked immoderately.&nbsp; It was
a pity, however, that he had bragged to Dawson about giving up smoking.&nbsp;
The pipes had better be kept in a cupboard for a week or two, till in
other and easier respects Ernest should have proved his steadfastness.&nbsp;
Then they might steal out again little by little&mdash;and so they did.</p>
<p>Ernest now wrote home a letter couched in a vein different from his
ordinary ones.&nbsp; His letters were usually all common form and padding,
for as I have already explained, if he wrote about anything that really
interested him, his mother always wanted to know more and more about
it&mdash;every fresh answer being as the lopping off of a hydra&rsquo;s
head and giving birth to half a dozen or more new questions&mdash;but
in the end it came invariably to the same result, namely, that he ought
to have done something else, or ought not to go on doing as he proposed.&nbsp;
Now, however, there was a new departure, and for the thousandth time
he concluded that he was about to take a course of which his father
and mother would approve, and in which they would be interested, so
that at last he and they might get on more sympathetically than heretofore.&nbsp;
He therefore wrote a gushing impulsive letter, which afforded much amusement
to myself as I read it, but which is too long for reproduction.&nbsp;
One passage ran: &ldquo;I am now going towards Christ; the greater number
of my college friends are, I fear, going away from Him; we must pray
for them that they may find the peace that is in Christ even as I have
myself found it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ernest covered his face with his hands
for shame as he read this extract from the bundle of letters he had
put into my hands&mdash;they had been returned to him by his father
on his mother&rsquo;s death, his mother having carefully preserved them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I cut it out?&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I will if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and if good-natured
friends have kept more records of my follies, pick out any plums that
may amuse the reader, and let him have his laugh over them.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But fancy what effect a letter like this&mdash;so unled up to&mdash;must
have produced at Battersby!&nbsp; Even Christina refrained from ecstasy
over her son&rsquo;s having discovered the power of Christ&rsquo;s word,
while Theobald was frightened out of his wits.&nbsp; It was well his
son was not going to have any doubts or difficulties, and that he would
be ordained without making a fuss over it, but he smelt mischief in
this sudden conversion of one who had never yet shown any inclination
towards religion.&nbsp; He hated people who did not know where to stop.&nbsp;
Ernest was always so <i>outr&eacute;</i> and strange; there was never
any knowing what he would do next, except that it would be something
unusual and silly.&nbsp; If he was to get the bit between his teeth
after he had got ordained and bought his living, he would play more
pranks than ever he, Theobald, had done.&nbsp; The fact, doubtless,
of his being ordained and having bought a living would go a long way
to steady him, and if he married, his wife must see to the rest; this
was his only chance and, to do justice to his sagacity, Theobald in
his heart did not think very highly of it.</p>
<p>When Ernest came down to Battersby in June, he imprudently tried
to open up a more unreserved communication with his father than was
his wont.&nbsp; The first of Ernest&rsquo;s snipe-like flights on being
flushed by Mr Hawke&rsquo;s sermon was in the direction of ultra-evangelicalism.&nbsp;
Theobald himself had been much more Low than High Church.&nbsp; This
was the normal development of the country clergyman during the first
years of his clerical life, between, we will say, the years 1825 to
1850; but he was not prepared for the almost contempt with which Ernest
now regarded the doctrines of baptismal regeneration and priestly absolution
(Hoity toity, indeed, what business had he with such questions?), nor
for his desire to find some means of reconciling Methodism and the Church.&nbsp;
Theobald hated the Church of Rome, but he hated dissenters too, for
he found them as a general rule troublesome people to deal with; he
always found people who did not agree with him troublesome to deal with:
besides, they set up for knowing as much as he did; nevertheless if
he had been let alone he would have leaned towards them rather than
towards the High Church party.&nbsp; The neighbouring clergy, however,
would not let him alone.&nbsp; One by one they had come under the influence,
directly or indirectly, of the Oxford movement which had begun twenty
years earlier.&nbsp; It was surprising how many practices he now tolerated
which in his youth he would have considered Popish; he knew very well
therefore which way things were going in Church matters, and saw that
as usual Ernest was setting himself the other way.&nbsp; The opportunity
for telling his son that he was a fool was too favourable not to be
embraced, and Theobald was not slow to embrace it.&nbsp; Ernest was
annoyed and surprised, for had not his father and mother been wanting
him to be more religious all his life?&nbsp; Now that he had become
so they were still not satisfied.&nbsp; He said to himself that a prophet
was not without honour save in his own country, but he had been lately&mdash;or
rather until lately&mdash;getting into an odious habit of turning proverbs
upside down, and it occurred to him that a country is sometimes not
without honour save for its own prophet.&nbsp; Then he laughed, and
for the rest of the day felt more as he used to feel before he had heard
Mr Hawke&rsquo;s sermon.</p>
<p>He returned to Cambridge for the Long Vacation of 1858&mdash;none
too soon, for he had to go in for the Voluntary Theological Examination,
which bishops were now beginning to insist upon.&nbsp; He imagined all
the time he was reading that he was storing himself with the knowledge
that would best fit him for the work he had taken in hand.&nbsp; In
truth, he was cramming for a pass.&nbsp; In due time he did pass&mdash;creditably,
and was ordained Deacon with half-a-dozen others of his friends in the
autumn of 1858.&nbsp; He was then just twenty-three years old.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LI</h2>
<p>Ernest had been ordained to a curacy in one of the central parts
of London.&nbsp; He hardly knew anything of London yet, but his instincts
drew him thither.&nbsp; The day after he was ordained he entered upon
his duties&mdash;feeling much as his father had done when he found himself
boxed up in the carriage with Christina on the morning of his marriage.&nbsp;
Before the first three days were over, he became aware that the light
of the happiness which he had known during his four years at Cambridge
had been extinguished, and he was appalled by the irrevocable nature
of the step which he now felt that he had taken much too hurriedly.</p>
<p>The most charitable excuse that I can make for the vagaries which
it will now be my duty to chronicle is that the shock of change consequent
upon his becoming suddenly religious, being ordained and leaving Cambridge,
had been too much for my hero, and had for the time thrown him off an
equilibrium which was yet little supported by experience, and therefore
as a matter of course unstable.</p>
<p>Everyone has a mass of bad work in him which he will have to work
off and get rid of before he can do better&mdash;and indeed, the more
lasting a man&rsquo;s ultimate good work is, the more sure he is to
pass through a time, and perhaps a very long one, in which there seems
very little hope for him at all.&nbsp; We must all sow our spiritual
wild oats.&nbsp; The fault I feel personally disposed to find with my
godson is not that he had wild oats to sow, but that they were such
an exceedingly tame and uninteresting crop.&nbsp; The sense of humour
and tendency to think for himself, of which till a few months previously
he had been showing fair promise, were nipped as though by a late frost,
while his earlier habit of taking on trust everything that was told
him by those in authority, and following everything out to the bitter
end, no matter how preposterous, returned with redoubled strength.&nbsp;
I suppose this was what might have been expected from anyone placed
as Ernest now was, especially when his antecedents are remembered, but
it surprised and disappointed some of his cooler-headed Cambridge friends
who had begun to think well of his ability.&nbsp; To himself it seemed
that religion was incompatible with half measures, or even with compromise.&nbsp;
Circumstances had led to his being ordained; for the moment he was sorry
they had, but he had done it and must go through with it.&nbsp; He therefore
set himself to find out what was expected of him, and to act accordingly.</p>
<p>His rector was a moderate High Churchman of no very pronounced views&mdash;an
elderly man who had had too many curates not to have long since found
out that the connection between rector and curate, like that between
employer and employed in every other walk of life, was a mere matter
of business.&nbsp; He had now two curates, of whom Ernest was the junior;
the senior curate was named Pryer, and when this gentleman made advances,
as he presently did, Ernest in his forlorn state was delighted to meet
them.</p>
<p>Pryer was about twenty-eight years old.&nbsp; He had been at Eton
and at Oxford.&nbsp; He was tall, and passed generally for good-looking;
I only saw him once for about five minutes, and then thought him odious
both in manners and appearance.&nbsp; Perhaps it was because he caught
me up in a way I did not like.&nbsp; I had quoted Shakespeare for lack
of something better to fill up a sentence&mdash;and had said that one
touch of nature made the whole world kin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said
Pryer, in a bold, brazen way which displeased me, &ldquo;but one touch
of the unnatural makes it more kindred still,&rdquo; and he gave me
a look as though he thought me an old bore and did not care two straws
whether I was shocked or not.&nbsp; Naturally enough, after this I did
not like him.</p>
<p>This, however, is anticipating, for it was not till Ernest had been
three or four months in London that I happened to meet his fellow-curate,
and I must deal here rather with the effect he produced upon my godson
than upon myself.&nbsp; Besides being what was generally considered
good-looking, he was faultless in his get-up, and altogether the kind
of man whom Ernest was sure to be afraid of and yet be taken in by.&nbsp;
The style of his dress was very High Church, and his acquaintances were
exclusively of the extreme High Church party, but he kept his views
a good deal in the background in his rector&rsquo;s presence, and that
gentleman, though he looked askance on some of Pryer&rsquo;s friends,
had no such ground of complaint against him as to make him sever the
connection.&nbsp; Pryer, too, was popular in the pulpit, and, take him
all round, it was probable that many worse curates would be found for
one better.&nbsp; When Pryer called on my hero, as soon as the two were
alone together, he eyed him all over with a quick penetrating glance
and seemed not dissatisfied with the result&mdash;for I must say here
that Ernest had improved in personal appearance under the more genial
treatment he had received at Cambridge.&nbsp; Pryer, in fact, approved
of him sufficiently to treat him civilly, and Ernest was immediately
won by anyone who did this.&nbsp; It was not long before he discovered
that the High Church party, and even Rome itself, had more to say for
themselves than he had thought.&nbsp; This was his first snipe-like
change of flight.</p>
<p>Pryer introduced him to several of his friends.&nbsp; They were all
of them young clergymen, belonging as I have said to the highest of
the High Church school, but Ernest was surprised to find how much they
resembled other people when among themselves.&nbsp; This was a shock
to him; it was ere long a still greater one to find that certain thoughts
which he had warred against as fatal to his soul, and which he had imagined
he should lose once for all on ordination, were still as troublesome
to him as they had been; he also saw plainly enough that the young gentlemen
who formed the circle of Pryer&rsquo;s friends were in much the same
unhappy predicament as himself.</p>
<p>This was deplorable.&nbsp; The only way out of it that Ernest could
see was that he should get married at once.&nbsp; But then he did not
know any one whom he wanted to marry.&nbsp; He did not know any woman,
in fact, whom he would not rather die than marry.&nbsp; It had been
one of Theobald&rsquo;s and Christina&rsquo;s main objects to keep him
out of the way of women, and they had so far succeeded that women had
become to him mysterious, inscrutable objects to be tolerated when it
was impossible to avoid them, but never to be sought out or encouraged.&nbsp;
As for any man loving, or even being at all fond of any woman, he supposed
it was so, but he believed the greater number of those who professed
such sentiments were liars.&nbsp; Now, however, it was clear that he
had hoped against hope too long, and that the only thing to do was to
go and ask the first woman who would listen to him to come and be married
to him as soon as possible.</p>
<p>He broached this to Pryer, and was surprised to find that this gentleman,
though attentive to such members of his flock as were young and good-looking,
was strongly in favour of the celibacy of the clergy, as indeed were
the other demure young clerics to whom Pryer had introduced Ernest.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LII</h2>
<p>&ldquo;You know, my dear Pontifex,&rdquo; said Pryer to him, some
few weeks after Ernest had become acquainted with him, when the two
were taking a constitutional one day in Kensington Gardens, &ldquo;You
know, my dear Pontifex, it is all very well to quarrel with Rome, but
Rome has reduced the treatment of the human soul to a science, while
our own Church, though so much purer in many respects, has no organised
system either of diagnosis or pathology&mdash;I mean, of course, spiritual
diagnosis and spiritual pathology.&nbsp; Our Church does not prescribe
remedies upon any settled system, and, what is still worse, even when
her physicians have according to their lights ascertained the disease
and pointed out the remedy, she has no discipline which will ensure
its being actually applied.&nbsp; If our patients do not choose to do
as we tell them, we cannot make them.&nbsp; Perhaps really under all
the circumstances this is as well, for we are spiritually mere horse
doctors as compared with the Roman priesthood, nor can we hope to make
much headway against the sin and misery that surround us, till we return
in some respects to the practice of our forefathers and of the greater
part of Christendom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest asked in what respects it was that his friend desired a return
to the practice of our forefathers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear fellow, can you really be ignorant?&nbsp; It
is just this, either the priest is indeed a spiritual guide, as being
able to show people how they ought to live better than they can find
out for themselves, or he is nothing at all&mdash;he has no <i>raison
d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i>.&nbsp; If the priest is not as much a healer
and director of men&rsquo;s souls as a physician is of their bodies,
what is he?&nbsp; The history of all ages has shown&mdash;and surely
you must know this as well as I do&mdash;that as men cannot cure the
bodies of their patients if they have not been properly trained in hospitals
under skilled teachers, so neither can souls be cured of their more
hidden ailments without the help of men who are skilled in soul-craft&mdash;or
in other words, of priests.&nbsp; What do one half of our formularies
and rubrics mean if not this?&nbsp; How in the name of all that is reasonable
can we find out the exact nature of a spiritual malady, unless we have
had experience of other similar cases?&nbsp; How can we get this without
express training?&nbsp; At present we have to begin all experiments
for ourselves, without profiting by the organised experience of our
predecessors, inasmuch as that experience is never organised and co-ordinated
at all.&nbsp; At the outset, therefore, each one of us must ruin many
souls which could be saved by knowledge of a few elementary principles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest was very much impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for men curing themselves,&rdquo; continued Pryer, &ldquo;they
can no more cure their own souls than they can cure their own bodies,
or manage their own law affairs.&nbsp; In these two last cases they
see the folly of meddling with their own cases clearly enough, and go
to a professional adviser as a matter of course; surely a man&rsquo;s
soul is at once a more difficult and intricate matter to treat, and
at the same time it is more important to him that it should be treated
rightly than that either his body or his money should be so.&nbsp; What
are we to think of the practice of a Church which encourages people
to rely on unprofessional advice in matters affecting their eternal
welfare, when they would not think of jeopardising their worldly affairs
by such insane conduct?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest could see no weak place in this.&nbsp; These ideas had crossed
his own mind vaguely before now, but he had never laid hold of them
or set them in an orderly manner before himself.&nbsp; Nor was he quick
at detecting false analogies and the misuse of metaphors; in fact he
was a mere child in the hands of his fellow curate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what,&rdquo; resumed Pryer, &ldquo;does all this point
to?&nbsp; Firstly, to the duty of confession&mdash;the outcry against
which is absurd as an outcry would be against dissection as part of
the training of medical students.&nbsp; Granted these young men must
see and do a great deal we do not ourselves like even to think of, but
they should adopt some other profession unless they are prepared for
this; they may even get inoculated with poison from a dead body and
lose their lives, but they must stand their chance.&nbsp; So if we aspire
to be priests in deed as well as name, we must familiarise ourselves
with the minutest and most repulsive details of all kinds of sin, so
that we may recognise it in all its stages.&nbsp; Some of us must doubtlessly
perish spiritually in such investigations.&nbsp; We cannot help it;
all science must have its martyrs, and none of these will deserve better
of humanity than those who have fallen in the pursuit of spiritual pathology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest grew more and more interested, but in the meekness of his
soul said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not desire this martyrdom for myself,&rdquo; continued
the other, &ldquo;on the contrary I will avoid it to the very utmost
of my power, but if it be God&rsquo;s will that I should fall while
studying what I believe most calculated to advance his glory&mdash;then,
I say, not my will, oh Lord, but thine be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was too much even for Ernest.&nbsp; &ldquo;I heard of an Irish-woman
once,&rdquo; he said, with a smile, &ldquo;who said she was a martyr
to the drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so she was,&rdquo; rejoined Pryer with warmth; and he
went on to show that this good woman was an experimentalist whose experiment,
though disastrous in its effects upon herself, was pregnant with instruction
to other people.&nbsp; She was thus a true martyr or witness to the
frightful consequences of intemperance, to the saving, doubtless, of
many who but for her martyrdom would have taken to drinking.&nbsp; She
was one of a forlorn hope whose failure to take a certain position went
to the proving it to be impregnable and therefore to the abandonment
of all attempt to take it.&nbsp; This was almost as great a gain to
mankind as the actual taking of the position would have been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he added more hurriedly, &ldquo;the limits
of vice and virtue are wretchedly ill-defined.&nbsp; Half the vices
which the world condemns most loudly have seeds of good in them and
require moderate use rather than total abstinence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest asked timidly for an instance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Pryer, &ldquo;I will give you no instance,
but I will give you a formula that shall embrace all instances.&nbsp;
It is this, that no practice is entirely vicious which has not been
extinguished among the comeliest, most vigorous, and most cultivated
races of mankind in spite of centuries of endeavour to extirpate it.&nbsp;
If a vice in spite of such efforts can still hold its own among the
most polished nations, it must be founded on some immutable truth or
fact in human nature, and must have some compensatory advantage which
we cannot afford altogether to dispense with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Ernest timidly, &ldquo;is not this virtually
doing away with all distinction between right and wrong, and leaving
people without any moral guide whatever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the people,&rdquo; was the answer: &ldquo;it must be our
care to be guides to these, for they are and always will be incapable
of guiding themselves sufficiently.&nbsp; We should tell them what they
must do, and in an ideal state of things should be able to enforce their
doing it: perhaps when we are better instructed the ideal state may
come about; nothing will so advance it as greater knowledge of spiritual
pathology on our own part.&nbsp; For this, three things are necessary;
firstly, absolute freedom in experiment for us the clergy; secondly,
absolute knowledge of what the laity think and do, and of what thoughts
and actions result in what spiritual conditions; and thirdly, a compacter
organisation among ourselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we are to do any good we must be a closely united body,
and must be sharply divided from the laity.&nbsp; Also we must be free
from those ties which a wife and children involve.&nbsp; I can hardly
express the horror with which I am filled by seeing English priests
living in what I can only designate as &lsquo;open matrimony.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It is deplorable.&nbsp; The priest must be absolutely sexless&mdash;if
not in practice, yet at any rate in theory, absolutely&mdash;and that
too, by a theory so universally accepted that none shall venture to
dispute it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Ernest, &ldquo;has not the Bible already
told people what they ought and ought not to do, and is it not enough
for us to insist on what can be found here, and let the rest alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you begin with the Bible,&rdquo; was the rejoinder, &ldquo;you
are three parts gone on the road to infidelity, and will go the other
part before you know where you are.&nbsp; The Bible is not without its
value to us the clergy, but for the laity it is a stumbling-block which
cannot be taken out of their way too soon or too completely.&nbsp; Of
course, I mean on the supposition that they read it, which, happily,
they seldom do.&nbsp; If people read the Bible as the ordinary British
churchman or churchwoman reads it, it is harmless enough; but if they
read it with any care&mdash;which we should assume they will if we give
it them at all&mdash;it is fatal to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Ernest, more and more astonished,
but more and more feeling that he was at least in the hands of a man
who had definite ideas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your question shows me that you have never read your Bible.&nbsp;
A more unreliable book was never put upon paper.&nbsp; Take my advice
and don&rsquo;t read it, not till you are a few years older, and may
do so safely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely you believe the Bible when it tells you of such
things as that Christ died and rose from the dead?&nbsp; Surely you
believe this?&rdquo; said Ernest, quite prepared to be told that Pryer
believed nothing of the kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not believe it, I know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how&mdash;if the testimony of the Bible fails?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On that of the living voice of the Church, which I know to
be infallible and to be informed of Christ himself.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LIII</h2>
<p>The foregoing conversation and others like it made a deep impression
upon my hero.&nbsp; If next day he had taken a walk with Mr Hawke, and
heard what he had to say on the other side, he would have been just
as much struck, and as ready to fling off what Pryer had told him, as
he now was to throw aside all he had ever heard from anyone except Pryer;
but there was no Mr Hawke at hand, so Pryer had everything his own way.</p>
<p>Embryo minds, like embryo bodies, pass through a number of strange
metamorphoses before they adopt their final shape.&nbsp; It is no more
to be wondered at that one who is going to turn out a Roman Catholic,
should have passed through the stages of being first a Methodist, and
then a free thinker, than that a man should at some former time have
been a mere cell, and later on an invertebrate animal.&nbsp; Ernest,
however, could not be expected to know this; embryos never do.&nbsp;
Embryos think with each stage of their development that they have now
reached the only condition which really suits them.&nbsp; This, they
say, must certainly be their last, inasmuch as its close will be so
great a shock that nothing can survive it.&nbsp; Every change is a shock;
every shock is a <i>pro tanto</i> death.&nbsp; What we call death is
only a shock great enough to destroy our power to recognise a past and
a present as resembling one another.&nbsp; It is the making us consider
the points of difference between our present and our past greater than
the points of resemblance, so that we can no longer call the former
of these two in any proper sense a continuation of the second, but find
it less trouble to think of it as something that we choose to call new.</p>
<p>But, to let this pass, it was clear that spiritual pathology (I confess
that I do not know myself what spiritual pathology means&mdash;but Pryer
and Ernest doubtless did) was the great desideratum of the age.&nbsp;
It seemed to Ernest that he had made this discovery himself and been
familiar with it all his life, that he had never known, in fact, of
anything else.&nbsp; He wrote long letters to his college friends expounding
his views as though he had been one of the Apostolic fathers.&nbsp;
As for the Old Testament writers, he had no patience with them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do oblige me,&rdquo; I find him writing to one friend, &ldquo;by
reading the prophet Zechariah, and giving me your candid opinion upon
him.&nbsp; He is poor stuff, full of Yankee bounce; it is sickening
to live in an age when such balderdash can be gravely admired whether
as poetry or prophecy.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was because Pryer had set him
against Zechariah.&nbsp; I do not know what Zechariah had done; I should
think myself that Zechariah was a very good prophet; perhaps it was
because he was a Bible writer, and not a very prominent one, that Pryer
selected him as one through whom to disparage the Bible in comparison
with the Church.</p>
<p>To his friend Dawson I find him saying a little later on: &ldquo;Pryer
and I continue our walks, working out each other&rsquo;s thoughts.&nbsp;
At first he used to do all the thinking, but I think I am pretty well
abreast of him now, and rather chuckle at seeing that he is already
beginning to modify some of the views he held most strongly when I first
knew him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I think he was on the high road to Rome; now, however,
he seems to be a good deal struck with a suggestion of mine in which
you, too, perhaps may be interested.&nbsp; You see we must infuse new
life into the Church somehow; we are not holding our own against either
Rome or infidelity.&rdquo;&nbsp; (I may say in passing that I do not
believe Ernest had as yet ever seen an infidel&mdash;not to speak to.)&nbsp;
&ldquo;I proposed, therefore, a few days back to Pryer&mdash;and he
fell in eagerly with the proposal as soon as he saw that I had the means
of carrying it out&mdash;that we should set on foot a spiritual movement
somewhat analogous to the Young England movement of twenty years ago,
the aim of which shall be at once to outbid Rome on the one hand, and
scepticism on the other.&nbsp; For this purpose I see nothing better
than the foundation of an institution or college for placing the nature
and treatment of sin on a more scientific basis than it rests at present.&nbsp;
We want&mdash;to borrow a useful term of Pryer&rsquo;s&mdash;a College
of Spiritual Pathology where young men&rdquo; (I suppose Ernest thought
he was no longer young by this time) &ldquo;may study the nature and
treatment of the sins of the soul as medical students study those of
the bodies of their patients.&nbsp; Such a college, as you will probably
admit, will approach both Rome on the one hand, and science on the other&mdash;Rome,
as giving the priesthood more skill, and therefore as paving the way
for their obtaining greater power, and science, by recognising that
even free thought has a certain kind of value in spiritual enquiries.&nbsp;
To this purpose Pryer and I have resolved to devote ourselves henceforth
heart and soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, my ideas are still unshaped, and all will depend
upon the men by whom the college is first worked.&nbsp; I am not yet
a priest, but Pryer is, and if I were to start the College, Pryer might
take charge of it for a time and I work under him nominally as his subordinate.&nbsp;
Pryer himself suggested this.&nbsp; Is it not generous of him?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst of it is that we have not enough money; I have,
it is true, &pound;5000, but we want at least &pound;10,000, so Pryer
says, before we can start; when we are fairly under weigh I might live
at the college and draw a salary from the foundation, so that it is
all one, or nearly so, whether I invest my money in this way or in buying
a living; besides I want very little; it is certain that I shall never
marry; no clergyman should think of this, and an unmarried man can live
on next to nothing.&nbsp; Still I do not see my way to as much money
as I want, and Pryer suggests that as we can hardly earn more now we
must get it by a judicious series of investments.&nbsp; Pryer knows
several people who make quite a handsome income out of very little or,
indeed, I may say, nothing at all, by buying things at a place they
call the Stock Exchange; I don&rsquo;t know much about it yet, but Pryer
says I should soon learn; he thinks, indeed, that I have shown rather
a talent in this direction, and under proper auspices should make a
very good man of business.&nbsp; Others, of course, and not I, must
decide this; but a man can do anything if he gives his mind to it, and
though I should not care about having more money for my own sake, I
care about it very much when I think of the good I could do with it
by saving souls from such horrible torture hereafter.&nbsp; Why, if
the thing succeeds, and I really cannot see what is to hinder it, it
is hardly possible to exaggerate its importance, nor the proportions
which it may ultimately assume,&rdquo; etc., etc.</p>
<p>Again I asked Ernest whether he minded my printing this.&nbsp; He
winced, but said &ldquo;No, not if it helps you to tell your story:
but don&rsquo;t you think it is too long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said it would let the reader see for himself how things were going
in half the time that it would take me to explain them to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then, keep it by all means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I continue turning over my file of Ernest&rsquo;s letters and find
as follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thanks for your last, in answer to which I send
you a rough copy of a letter I sent to the <i>Times</i> a day or two
back.&nbsp; They did not insert it, but it embodies pretty fully my
ideas on the parochial visitation question, and Pryer fully approves
of the letter.&nbsp; Think it carefully over and send it back to me
when read, for it is so exactly my present creed that I cannot afford
to lose it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should very much like to have a <i>viva voce</i> discussion
on these matters: I can only see for certain that we have suffered a
dreadful loss in being no longer able to excommunicate.&nbsp; We should
excommunicate rich and poor alike, and pretty freely too.&nbsp; If this
power were restored to us we could, I think, soon put a stop to by far
the greater part of the sin and misery with which we are surrounded.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These letters were written only a few weeks after Ernest had been
ordained, but they are nothing to others that he wrote a little later
on.</p>
<p>In his eagerness to regenerate the Church of England (and through
this the universe) by the means which Pryer had suggested to him, it
occurred to him to try to familiarise himself with the habits and thoughts
of the poor by going and living among them.&nbsp; I think he got this
notion from Kingsley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alton Locke,&rdquo; which, High
Churchman though he for the nonce was, he had devoured as he had devoured
Stanley&rsquo;s Life of Arnold, Dickens&rsquo;s novels, and whatever
other literary garbage of the day was most likely to do him harm; at
any rate he actually put his scheme into practice, and took lodgings
in Ashpit Place, a small street in the neighbourhood of Drury Lane Theatre,
in a house of which the landlady was the widow of a cabman.</p>
<p>This lady occupied the whole ground floor.&nbsp; In the front kitchen
there was a tinker.&nbsp; The back kitchen was let to a bellows-mender.&nbsp;
On the first floor came Ernest, with his two rooms which he furnished
comfortably, for one must draw the line somewhere.&nbsp; The two upper
floors were parcelled out among four different sets of lodgers: there
was a tailor named Holt, a drunken fellow who used to beat his wife
at night till her screams woke the house; above him there was another
tailor with a wife but no children; these people were Wesleyans, given
to drink but not noisy.&nbsp; The two back rooms were held by single
ladies, who it seemed to Ernest must be respectably connected, for well-dressed
gentlemanly-looking young men used to go up and down stairs past Ernest&rsquo;s
rooms to call at any rate on Miss Snow&mdash;Ernest had heard her door
slam after they had passed.&nbsp; He thought, too, that some of them
went up to Miss Maitland&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Mrs Jupp, the landlady, told
Ernest that these were brothers and cousins of Miss Snow&rsquo;s, and
that she was herself looking out for a situation as a governess, but
at present had an engagement as an actress at the Drury Lane Theatre.&nbsp;
Ernest asked whether Miss Maitland in the top back was also looking
out for a situation, and was told she was wanting an engagement as a
milliner.&nbsp; He believed whatever Mrs Jupp told him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LIV</h2>
<p>This move on Ernest&rsquo;s part was variously commented upon by
his friends, the general opinion being that it was just like Pontifex,
who was sure to do something unusual wherever he went, but that on the
whole the idea was commendable.&nbsp; Christina could not restrain herself
when on sounding her clerical neighbours she found them inclined to
applaud her son for conduct which they idealised into something much
more self-denying than it really was.&nbsp; She did not quite like his
living in such an unaristocratic neighbourhood; but what he was doing
would probably get into the newspapers, and then great people would
take notice of him.&nbsp; Besides, it would be very cheap; down among
these poor people he could live for next to nothing, and might put by
a great deal of his income.&nbsp; As for temptations, there could be
few or none in such a place as that.&nbsp; This argument about cheapness
was the one with which she most successfully met Theobald, who grumbled
more <i>suo</i> that he had no sympathy with his son&rsquo;s extravagance
and conceit.&nbsp; When Christina pointed out to him that it would be
cheap he replied that there was something in that.</p>
<p>On Ernest himself the effect was to confirm the good opinion of himself
which had been growing upon him ever since he had begun to read for
orders, and to make him flatter himself that he was among the few who
were ready to give up <i>all</i> for Christ.&nbsp; Ere long he began
to conceive of himself as a man with a mission and a great future.&nbsp;
His lightest and most hastily formed opinions began to be of momentous
importance to him, and he inflicted them, as I have already shown, on
his old friends, week by week becoming more and more <i>ent&ecirc;t&eacute;</i>
with himself and his own crotchets.&nbsp; I should like well enough
to draw a veil over this part of my hero&rsquo;s career, but cannot
do so without marring my story.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1859 I find him writing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I cannot call the visible Church Christian till
its fruits are Christian, that is until the fruits of the members of
the Church of England are in conformity, or something like conformity,
with her teaching.&nbsp; I cordially agree with the teaching of the
Church of England in most respects, but she says one thing and does
another, and until excommunication&mdash;yes, and wholesale excommunication&mdash;be
resorted to, I cannot call her a Christian institution.&nbsp; I should
begin with our Rector, and if I found it necessary to follow him up
by excommunicating the Bishop, I should not flinch even from this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The present London Rectors are hopeless people to deal with.&nbsp;
My own is one of the best of them, but the moment Pryer and I show signs
of wanting to attack an evil in a way not recognised by routine, or
of remedying anything about which no outcry has been made, we are met
with, &lsquo;I cannot think what you mean by all this disturbance; nobody
else among the clergy sees these things, and I have no wish to be the
first to begin turning everything topsy-turvy.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then
people call him a sensible man.&nbsp; I have no patience with them.&nbsp;
However, we know what we want, and, as I wrote to Dawson the other day,
have a scheme on foot which will, I think, fairly meet the requirements
of the case.&nbsp; But we want more money, and my first move towards
getting this has not turned out quite so satisfactorily as Pryer and
I had hoped; we shall, however, I doubt not, retrieve it shortly.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Ernest came to London he intended doing a good deal of house-to-house
visiting, but Pryer had talked him out of this even before he settled
down in his new and strangely-chosen apartments.&nbsp; The line he now
took was that if people wanted Christ, they must prove their want by
taking some little trouble, and the trouble required of them was that
they should come and seek him, Ernest, out; there he was in the midst
of them ready to teach; if people did not choose to come to him it was
no fault of his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My great business here,&rdquo; he writes again to Dawson,
&ldquo;is to observe.&nbsp; I am not doing much in parish work beyond
my share of the daily services.&nbsp; I have a man&rsquo;s Bible Class,
and a boy&rsquo;s Bible Class, and a good many young men and boys to
whom I give instruction one way or another; then there are the Sunday
School children, with whom I fill my room on a Sunday evening as full
as it will hold, and let them sing hymns and chants.&nbsp; They like
this.&nbsp; I do a great deal of reading&mdash;chiefly of books which
Pryer and I think most likely to help; we find nothing comparable to
the Jesuits.&nbsp; Pryer is a thorough gentleman, and an admirable man
of business&mdash;no less observant of the things of this world, in
fact, than of the things above; by a brilliant coup he has retrieved,
or nearly so, a rather serious loss which threatened to delay indefinitely
the execution of our great scheme.&nbsp; He and I daily gather fresh
principles.&nbsp; I believe great things are before me, and am strong
in the hope of being able by and by to effect much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for you I bid you God speed.&nbsp; Be bold but logical,
speculative but cautious, daringly courageous, but properly circumspect
withal,&rdquo; etc., etc.</p>
<p>I think this may do for the present.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LV</h2>
<p>I had called on Ernest as a matter of course when he first came to
London, but had not seen him.&nbsp; I had been out when he returned
my call, so that he had been in town for some weeks before I actually
saw him, which I did not very long after he had taken possession of
his new rooms.&nbsp; I liked his face, but except for the common bond
of music, in respect of which our tastes were singularly alike, I should
hardly have known how to get on with him.&nbsp; To do him justice he
did not air any of his schemes to me until I had drawn him out concerning
them.&nbsp; I, to borrow the words of Ernest&rsquo;s landlady, Mrs Jupp,
&ldquo;am not a very regular church-goer&rdquo;&mdash;I discovered upon
cross-examination that Mrs Jupp had been to church once when she was
churched for her son Tom some five and twenty years since, but never
either before or afterwards; not even, I fear, to be married, for though
she called herself &ldquo;Mrs&rdquo; she wore no wedding ring, and spoke
of the person who should have been Mr Jupp as &ldquo;my poor dear boy&rsquo;s
father,&rdquo; not as &ldquo;my husband.&rdquo;&nbsp; But to return.&nbsp;
I was vexed at Ernest&rsquo;s having been ordained.&nbsp; I was not
ordained myself and I did not like my friends to be ordained, nor did
I like having to be on my best behaviour and to look as if butter would
not melt in my mouth, and all for a boy whom I remembered when he knew
yesterday and to-morrow and Tuesday, but not a day of the week more&mdash;not
even Sunday itself&mdash;and when he said he did not like the kitten
because it had pins in its toes.</p>
<p>I looked at him and thought of his aunt Alethea, and how fast the
money she had left him was accumulating; and it was all to go to this
young man, who would use it probably in the very last ways with which
Miss Pontifex would have sympathised.&nbsp; I was annoyed.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
always said,&rdquo; I thought to myself, &ldquo;that she should make
a mess of it, but I did not think she would have made as great a mess
of it as this.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then I thought that perhaps if his aunt
had lived he would not have been like this.</p>
<p>Ernest behaved quite nicely to me and I own that the fault was mine
if the conversation drew towards dangerous subjects.&nbsp; I was the
aggressor, presuming I suppose upon my age and long acquaintance with
him, as giving me a right to make myself unpleasant in a quiet way.</p>
<p>Then he came out, and the exasperating part of it was that up to
a certain point he was so very right.&nbsp; Grant him his premises and
his conclusions were sound enough, nor could I, seeing that he was already
ordained, join issue with him about his premises as I should certainly
have done if I had had a chance of doing so before he had taken orders.&nbsp;
The result was that I had to beat a retreat and went away not in the
best of humours.&nbsp; I believe the truth was that I liked Ernest,
and was vexed at his being a clergyman, and at a clergyman having so
much money coming to him.</p>
<p>I talked a little with Mrs Jupp on my way out.&nbsp; She and I had
reckoned one another up at first sight as being neither of us &ldquo;very
regular church-goers,&rdquo; and the strings of her tongue had been
loosened.&nbsp; She said Ernest would die.&nbsp; He was much too good
for the world and he looked so sad &ldquo;just like young Watkins of
the &lsquo;Crown&rsquo; over the way who died a month ago, and his poor
dear skin was white as alablaster; least-ways they say he shot hisself.&nbsp;
They took him from the Mortimer, I met them just as I was going with
my Rose to get a pint o&rsquo; four ale, and she had her arm in splints.&nbsp;
She told her sister she wanted to go to Perry&rsquo;s to get some wool,
instead o&rsquo; which it was only a stall to get me a pint o&rsquo;
ale, bless her heart; there&rsquo;s nobody else would do that much for
poor old Jupp, and it&rsquo;s a horrid lie to say she is gay; not but
what I like a gay woman, I do: I&rsquo;d rather give a gay woman half-a-crown
than stand a modest woman a pot o&rsquo; beer, but I don&rsquo;t want
to go associating with bad girls for all that.&nbsp; So they took him
from the Mortimer; they wouldn&rsquo;t let him go home no more; and
he done it that artful you know.&nbsp; His wife was in the country living
with her mother, and she always spoke respectful o&rsquo; my Rose.&nbsp;
Poor dear, I hope his soul is in Heaven.&nbsp; Well Sir, would you believe
it, there&rsquo;s that in Mr Pontifex&rsquo;s face which is just like
young Watkins; he looks that worrited and scrunched up at times, but
it&rsquo;s never for the same reason, for he don&rsquo;t know nothing
at all, no more than a unborn babe, no he don&rsquo;t; why there&rsquo;s
not a monkey going about London with an Italian organ grinder but knows
more than Mr Pontifex do.&nbsp; He don&rsquo;t know&mdash;well I suppose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here a child came in on an errand from some neighbour and interrupted
her, or I can form no idea where or when she would have ended her discourse.&nbsp;
I seized the opportunity to run away, but not before I had given her
five shillings and made her write down my address, for I was a little
frightened by what she said.&nbsp; I told her if she thought her lodger
grew worse, she was to come and let me know.</p>
<p>Weeks went by and I did not see her again.&nbsp; Having done as much
as I had, I felt absolved from doing more, and let Ernest alone as thinking
that he and I should only bore one another.</p>
<p>He had now been ordained a little over four months, but these months
had not brought happiness or satisfaction with them.&nbsp; He had lived
in a clergyman&rsquo;s house all his life, and might have been expected
perhaps to have known pretty much what being a clergyman was like, and
so he did&mdash;a country clergyman; he had formed an ideal, however,
as regards what a town clergyman could do, and was trying in a feeble
tentative way to realise it, but somehow or other it always managed
to escape him.</p>
<p>He lived among the poor, but he did not find that he got to know
them.&nbsp; The idea that they would come to him proved to be a mistaken
one.&nbsp; He did indeed visit a few tame pets whom his rector desired
him to look after.&nbsp; There was an old man and his wife who lived
next door but one to Ernest himself; then there was a plumber of the
name of Chesterfield; an aged lady of the name of Gover, blind and bed-ridden,
who munched and munched her feeble old toothless jaws as Ernest spoke
or read to her, but who could do little more; a Mr Brookes, a rag and
bottle merchant in Birdsey&rsquo;s Rents in the last stage of dropsy,
and perhaps half a dozen or so others.&nbsp; What did it all come to,
when he did go to see them?&nbsp; The plumber wanted to be flattered,
and liked fooling a gentleman into wasting his time by scratching his
ears for him.&nbsp; Mrs Gover, poor old woman, wanted money; she was
very good and meek, and when Ernest got her a shilling from Lady Anne
Jones&rsquo;s bequest, she said it was &ldquo;small but seasonable,&rdquo;
and munched and munched in gratitude.&nbsp; Ernest sometimes gave her
a little money himself, but not, as he says now, half what he ought
to have given.</p>
<p>What could he do else that would have been of the smallest use to
her?&nbsp; Nothing indeed; but giving occasional half-crowns to Mrs
Gover was not regenerating the universe, and Ernest wanted nothing short
of this.&nbsp; The world was all out of joint, and instead of feeling
it to be a cursed spite that he was born to set it right, he thought
he was just the kind of person that was wanted for the job, and was
eager to set to work, only he did not exactly know how to begin, for
the beginning he had made with Mr Chesterfield and Mrs Gover did not
promise great developments.</p>
<p>Then poor Mr Brookes&mdash;he suffered very much, terribly indeed;
he was not in want of money; he wanted to die and couldn&rsquo;t, just
as we sometimes want to go to sleep and cannot.&nbsp; He had been a
serious-minded man, and death frightened him as it must frighten anyone
who believes that all his most secret thoughts will be shortly exposed
in public.&nbsp; When I read Ernest the description of how his father
used to visit Mrs Thompson at Battersby, he coloured and said&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s
just what I used to say to Mr Brookes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ernest felt that
his visits, so far from comforting Mr Brookes, made him fear death more
and more, but how could he help it?</p>
<p>Even Pryer, who had been curate a couple of years, did not know personally
more than a couple of hundred people in the parish at the outside, and
it was only at the houses of very few of these that he ever visited,
but then Pryer had such a strong objection on principle to house visitations.&nbsp;
What a drop in the sea were those with whom he and Pryer were brought
into direct communication in comparison with those whom he must reach
and move if he were to produce much effect of any kind, one way or the
other.&nbsp; Why there were between fifteen and twenty thousand poor
in the parish, of whom but the merest fraction ever attended a place
of worship.&nbsp; Some few went to dissenting chapels, a few were Roman
Catholics; by far the greater number, however, were practically infidels,
if not actively hostile, at any rate indifferent to religion, while
many were avowed Atheists&mdash;admirers of Tom Paine, of whom he now
heard for the first time; but he never met and conversed with any of
these.</p>
<p>Was he really doing everything that could be expected of him?&nbsp;
It was all very well to say that he was doing as much as other young
clergymen did; that was not the kind of answer which Jesus Christ was
likely to accept; why, the Pharisees themselves in all probability did
as much as the other Pharisees did.&nbsp; What he should do was to go
into the highways and byways, and compel people to come in.&nbsp; Was
he doing this?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or were not they rather compelling him to
keep out&mdash;outside their doors at any rate?&nbsp; He began to have
an uneasy feeling as though ere long, unless he kept a sharp look out,
he should drift into being a sham.</p>
<p>True, all would be changed as soon as he could endow the College
for Spiritual Pathology; matters, however, had not gone too well with
&ldquo;the things that people bought in the place that was called the
Stock Exchange.&rdquo;&nbsp; In order to get on faster, it had been
arranged that Ernest should buy more of these things than he could pay
for, with the idea that in a few weeks, or even days, they would be
much higher in value, and he could sell them at a tremendous profit;
but, unfortunately, instead of getting higher, they had fallen immediately
after Ernest had bought, and obstinately refused to get up again; so,
after a few settlements, he had got frightened, for he read an article
in some newspaper, which said they would go ever so much lower, and,
contrary to Pryer&rsquo;s advice, he insisted on selling&mdash;at a
loss of something like &pound;500.&nbsp; He had hardly sold when up
went the shares again, and he saw how foolish he had been, and how wise
Pryer was, for if Pryer&rsquo;s advice had been followed, he would have
made &pound;500, instead of losing it.&nbsp; However, he told himself
he must live and learn.</p>
<p>Then Pryer made a mistake.&nbsp; They had bought some shares, and
the shares went up delightfully for about a fortnight.&nbsp; This was
a happy time indeed, for by the end of a fortnight, the lost &pound;500
had been recovered, and three or four hundred pounds had been cleared
into the bargain.&nbsp; All the feverish anxiety of that miserable six
weeks, when the &pound;500 was being lost, was now being repaid with
interest.&nbsp; Ernest wanted to sell and make sure of the profit, but
Pryer would not hear of it; they would go ever so much higher yet, and
he showed Ernest an article in some newspaper which proved that what
he said was reasonable, and they did go up a little&mdash;but only a
very little, for then they went down, down, and Ernest saw first his
clear profit of three or four hundred pounds go, and then the &pound;500
loss, which he thought he had recovered, slipped away by falls of a
half and one at a time, and then he lost &pound;200 more.&nbsp; Then
a newspaper said that these shares were the greatest rubbish that had
ever been imposed upon the English public, and Ernest could stand it
no longer, so he sold out, again this time against Pryer&rsquo;s advice,
so that when they went up, as they shortly did, Pryer scored off Ernest
a second time.</p>
<p>Ernest was not used to vicissitudes of this kind, and they made him
so anxious that his health was affected.&nbsp; It was arranged therefore
that he had better know nothing of what was being done.&nbsp; Pryer
was a much better man of business than he was, and would see to it all.&nbsp;
This relieved Ernest of a good deal of trouble, and was better after
all for the investments themselves; for, as Pryer justly said, a man
must not have a faint heart if he hopes to succeed in buying and selling
upon the Stock Exchange, and seeing Ernest nervous made Pryer nervous
too&mdash;at least, he said it did.&nbsp; So the money drifted more
and more into Pryer&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; As for Pryer himself, he had
nothing but his curacy and a small allowance from his father.</p>
<p>Some of Ernest&rsquo;s old friends got an inkling from his letters
of what he was doing, and did their utmost to dissuade him, but he was
as infatuated as a young lover of two and twenty.&nbsp; Finding that
these friends disapproved, he dropped away from them, and they, being
bored with his egotism and high-flown ideas, were not sorry to let him
do so.&nbsp; Of course, he said nothing about his speculations&mdash;indeed,
he hardly knew that anything done in so good a cause could be called
speculation.&nbsp; At Battersby, when his father urged him to look out
for a next presentation, and even brought one or two promising ones
under his notice, he made objections and excuses, though always promising
to do as his father desired very shortly.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LVI</h2>
<p>By and by a subtle, indefinable <i>malaise</i> began to take possession
of him.&nbsp; I once saw a very young foal trying to eat some most objectionable
refuse, and unable to make up its mind whether it was good or no.&nbsp;
Clearly it wanted to be told.&nbsp; If its mother had seen what it was
doing she would have set it right in a moment, and as soon as ever it
had been told that what it was eating was filth, the foal would have
recognised it and never have wanted to be told again; but the foal could
not settle the matter for itself, or make up its mind whether it liked
what it was trying to eat or no, without assistance from without.&nbsp;
I suppose it would have come to do so by and by, but it was wasting
time and trouble, which a single look from its mother would have saved,
just as wort will in time ferment of itself, but will ferment much more
quickly if a little yeast be added to it.&nbsp; In the matter of knowing
what gives us pleasure we are all like wort, and if unaided from without
can only ferment slowly and toilsomely.</p>
<p>My unhappy hero about this time was very much like the foal, or rather
he felt much what the foal would have felt if its mother and all the
other grown-up horses in the field had vowed that what it was eating
was the most excellent and nutritious food to be found anywhere.&nbsp;
He was so anxious to do what was right, and so ready to believe that
every one knew better than himself, that he never ventured to admit
to himself that he might be all the while on a hopelessly wrong tack.&nbsp;
It did not occur to him that there might be a blunder anywhere, much
less did it occur to him to try and find out where the blunder was.&nbsp;
Nevertheless he became daily more full of <i>malaise</i>, and daily,
only he knew it not, more ripe for an explosion should a spark fall
upon him.</p>
<p>One thing, however, did begin to loom out of the general vagueness,
and to this he instinctively turned as trying to seize it&mdash;I mean,
the fact that he was saving very few souls, whereas there were thousands
and thousands being lost hourly all around him which a little energy
such as Mr Hawke&rsquo;s might save.&nbsp; Day after day went by, and
what was he doing?&nbsp; Standing on professional <i>etiquette</i>,
and praying that his shares might go up and down as he wanted them,
so that they might give him money enough to enable him to regenerate
the universe.&nbsp; But in the meantime the people were dying.&nbsp;
How many souls would not be doomed to endless ages of the most frightful
torments that the mind could think of, before he could bring his spiritual
pathology engine to bear upon them?&nbsp; Why might he not stand and
preach as he saw the Dissenters doing sometimes in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn
Fields and other thoroughfares?&nbsp; He could say all that Mr Hawke
had said.&nbsp; Mr Hawke was a very poor creature in Ernest&rsquo;s
eyes now, for he was a Low Churchman, but we should not be above learning
from any one, and surely he could affect his hearers as powerfully as
Mr Hawke had affected him if he only had the courage to set to work.&nbsp;
The people whom he saw preaching in the squares sometimes drew large
audiences.&nbsp; He could at any rate preach better than they.</p>
<p>Ernest broached this to Pryer, who treated it as something too outrageous
to be even thought of.&nbsp; Nothing, he said, could more tend to lower
the dignity of the clergy and bring the Church into contempt.&nbsp;
His manner was brusque, and even rude.</p>
<p>Ernest ventured a little mild dissent; he admitted it was not usual,
but something at any rate must be done, and that quickly.&nbsp; This
was how Wesley and Whitfield had begun that great movement which had
kindled religious life in the minds of hundreds of thousands.&nbsp;
This was no time to be standing on dignity.&nbsp; It was just because
Wesley and Whitfield had done what the Church would not that they had
won men to follow them whom the Church had now lost.</p>
<p>Pryer eyed Ernest searchingly, and after a pause said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know what to make of you, Pontifex; you are at once so very right and
so very wrong.&nbsp; I agree with you heartily that something should
be done, but it must not be done in a way which experience has shown
leads to nothing but fanaticism and dissent.&nbsp; Do you approve of
these Wesleyans?&nbsp; Do you hold your ordination vows so cheaply as
to think that it does not matter whether the services of the Church
are performed in her churches and with all due ceremony or not?&nbsp;
If you do&mdash;then, frankly, you had no business to be ordained; if
you do not, then remember that one of the first duties of a young deacon
is obedience to authority.&nbsp; Neither the Catholic Church, nor yet
the Church of England allows her clergy to preach in the streets of
cities where there is no lack of churches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest felt the force of this, and Pryer saw that he wavered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are living,&rdquo; he continued more genially, &ldquo;in
an age of transition, and in a country which, though it has gained much
by the Reformation, does not perceive how much it has also lost.&nbsp;
You cannot and must not hawk Christ about in the streets as though you
were in a heathen country whose inhabitants had never heard of him.&nbsp;
The people here in London have had ample warning.&nbsp; Every church
they pass is a protest to them against their lives, and a call to them
to repent.&nbsp; Every church-bell they hear is a witness against them,
everyone of those whom they meet on Sundays going to or coming from
church is a warning voice from God.&nbsp; If these countless influences
produce no effect upon them, neither will the few transient words which
they would hear from you.&nbsp; You are like Dives, and think that if
one rose from the dead they would hear him.&nbsp; Perhaps they might;
but then you cannot pretend that you have risen from the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the last few words were spoken laughingly, there was a sub-sneer
about them which made Ernest wince; but he was quite subdued, and so
the conversation ended.&nbsp; It left Ernest, however, not for the first
time, consciously dissatisfied with Pryer, and inclined to set his friend&rsquo;s
opinion on one side&mdash;not openly, but quietly, and without telling
Pryer anything about it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LVII</h2>
<p>He had hardly parted from Pryer before there occurred another incident
which strengthened his discontent.&nbsp; He had fallen, as I have shown,
among a gang of spiritual thieves or coiners, who passed the basest
metal upon him without his finding it out, so childish and inexperienced
was he in the ways of anything but those back eddies of the world, schools
and universities.&nbsp; Among the bad threepenny pieces which had been
passed off upon him, and which he kept for small hourly disbursement,
was a remark that poor people were much nicer than the richer and better
educated.&nbsp; Ernest now said that he always travelled third class
not because it was cheaper, but because the people whom he met in third
class carriages were so much pleasanter and better behaved.&nbsp; As
for the young men who attended Ernest&rsquo;s evening classes, they
were pronounced to be more intelligent and better ordered generally
than the average run of Oxford and Cambridge men.&nbsp; Our foolish
young friend having heard Pryer talk to this effect, caught up all he
said and reproduced it <i>more suo</i>.</p>
<p>One evening, however, about this time, whom should he see coming
along a small street not far from his own but, of all persons in the
world, Towneley, looking as full of life and good spirits as ever, and
if possible even handsomer than he had been at Cambridge.&nbsp; Much
as Ernest liked him he found himself shrinking from speaking to him,
and was endeavouring to pass him without doing so when Towneley saw
him and stopped him at once, being pleased to see an old Cambridge face.&nbsp;
He seemed for the moment a little confused at being seen in such a neighbourhood,
but recovered himself so soon that Ernest hardly noticed it, and then
plunged into a few kindly remarks about old times.&nbsp; Ernest felt
that he quailed as he saw Towneley&rsquo;s eye wander to his white necktie
and saw that he was being reckoned up, and rather disapprovingly reckoned
up, as a parson.&nbsp; It was the merest passing shade upon Towneley&rsquo;s
face, but Ernest had felt it.</p>
<p>Towneley said a few words of common form to Ernest about his profession
as being what he thought would be most likely to interest him, and Ernest,
still confused and shy, gave him for lack of something better to say
his little threepenny-bit about poor people being so very nice.&nbsp;
Towneley took this for what it was worth and nodded assent, whereon
Ernest imprudently went further and said &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like
poor people very much yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Towneley gave his face a comical but good-natured screw, and said
quietly, but slowly and decidedly, &ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; and escaped.</p>
<p>It was all over with Ernest from that moment.&nbsp; As usual he did
not know it, but he had entered none the less upon another reaction.&nbsp;
Towneley had just taken Ernest&rsquo;s threepenny-bit into his hands,
looked at it and returned it to him as a bad one.&nbsp; Why did he see
in a moment that it was a bad one now, though he had been unable to
see it when he had taken it from Pryer?&nbsp; Of course some poor people
were very nice, and always would be so, but as though scales had fallen
suddenly from his eyes he saw that no one was nicer for being poor,
and that between the upper and lower classes there was a gulf which
amounted practically to an impassable barrier.</p>
<p>That evening he reflected a good deal.&nbsp; If Towneley was right,
and Ernest felt that the &ldquo;No&rdquo; had applied not to the remark
about poor people only, but to the whole scheme and scope of his own
recently adopted ideas, he and Pryer must surely be on a wrong track.&nbsp;
Towneley had not argued with him; he had said one word only, and that
one of the shortest in the language, but Ernest was in a fit state for
inoculation, and the minute particle of virus set about working immediately.</p>
<p>Which did he now think was most likely to have taken the juster view
of life and things, and whom would it be best to imitate, Towneley or
Pryer?&nbsp; His heart returned answer to itself without a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation.&nbsp; The faces of men like Towneley were open and kindly;
they looked as if at ease themselves, and as though they would set all
who had to do with them at ease as far as might be.&nbsp; The faces
of Pryer and his friends were not like this.&nbsp; Why had he felt tacitly
rebuked as soon as he had met Towneley?&nbsp; Was he not a Christian?&nbsp;
Certainly; he believed in the Church of England as a matter of course.&nbsp;
Then how could he be himself wrong in trying to act up to the faith
that he and Towneley held in common?&nbsp; He was trying to lead a quiet,
unobtrusive life of self-devotion, whereas Towneley was not, so far
as he could see, trying to do anything of the kind; he was only trying
to get on comfortably in the world, and to look and be as nice as possible.&nbsp;
And he was nice, and Ernest knew that such men as himself and Pryer
were not nice, and his old dejection came over him.</p>
<p>Then came an even worse reflection; how if he had fallen among material
thieves as well as spiritual ones?&nbsp; He knew very little of how
his money was going on; he had put it all now into Pryer&rsquo;s hands,
and though Pryer gave him cash to spend whenever he wanted it, he seemed
impatient of being questioned as to what was being done with the principal.&nbsp;
It was part of the understanding, he said, that that was to be left
to him, and Ernest had better stick to this, or he, Pryer, would throw
up the College of Spiritual Pathology altogether; and so Ernest was
cowed into acquiescence, or cajoled, according to the humour in which
Pryer saw him to be.&nbsp; Ernest thought that further questions would
look as if he doubted Pryer&rsquo;s word, and also that he had gone
too far to be able to recede in decency or honour.&nbsp; This, however,
he felt was riding out to meet trouble unnecessarily.&nbsp; Pryer had
been a little impatient, but he was a gentleman and an admirable man
of business, so his money would doubtless come back to him all right
some day.</p>
<p>Ernest comforted himself as regards this last source of anxiety,
but as regards the other, he began to feel as though, if he was to be
saved, a good Samaritan must hurry up from somewhere&mdash;he knew not
whence.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LVIII</h2>
<p>Next day he felt stronger again.&nbsp; He had been listening to the
voice of the evil one on the night before, and would parley no more
with such thoughts.&nbsp; He had chosen his profession, and his duty
was to persevere with it.&nbsp; If he was unhappy it was probably because
he was not giving up all for Christ.&nbsp; Let him see whether he could
not do more than he was doing now, and then perhaps a light would be
shed upon his path.</p>
<p>It was all very well to have made the discovery that he didn&rsquo;t
very much like poor people, but he had got to put up with them, for
it was among them that his work must lie.&nbsp; Such men as Towneley
were very kind and considerate, but he knew well enough it was only
on condition that he did not preach to them.&nbsp; He could manage the
poor better, and, let Pryer sneer as he liked, he was resolved to go
more among them, and try the effect of bringing Christ to them if they
would not come and seek Christ of themselves.&nbsp; He would begin with
his own house.</p>
<p>Who then should he take first?&nbsp; Surely he could not do better
than begin with the tailor who lived immediately over his head.&nbsp;
This would be desirable, not only because he was the one who seemed
to stand most in need of conversion, but also because, if he were once
converted, he would no longer beat his wife at two o&rsquo;clock in
the morning, and the house would be much pleasanter in consequence.&nbsp;
He would therefore go upstairs at once, and have a quiet talk with this
man.</p>
<p>Before doing so, he thought it would be well if he were to draw up
something like a plan of a campaign; he therefore reflected over some
pretty conversations which would do very nicely if Mr Holt would be
kind enough to make the answers proposed for him in their proper places.&nbsp;
But the man was a great hulking fellow, of a savage temper, and Ernest
was forced to admit that unforeseen developments might arise to disconcert
him.&nbsp; They say it takes nine tailors to make a man, but Ernest
felt that it would take at least nine Ernests to make a Mr Holt.&nbsp;
How if, as soon as Ernest came in, the tailor were to become violent
and abusive?&nbsp; What could he do?&nbsp; Mr Holt was in his own lodgings,
and had a right to be undisturbed.&nbsp; A legal right, yes, but had
he a moral right?&nbsp; Ernest thought not, considering his mode of
life.&nbsp; But put this on one side; if the man were to be violent,
what should he do?&nbsp; Paul had fought with wild beasts at Ephesus&mdash;that
must indeed have been awful&mdash;but perhaps they were not very wild
wild beasts; a rabbit and a canary are wild beasts; but, formidable
or not as wild beasts go, they would, nevertheless stand no chance against
St Paul, for he was inspired; the miracle would have been if the wild
beasts escaped, not that St Paul should have done so; but, however all
this might be, Ernest felt that he dared not begin to convert Mr Holt
by fighting him.&nbsp; Why, when he had heard Mrs Holt screaming &ldquo;murder,&rdquo;
he had cowered under the bed clothes and waited, expecting to hear the
blood dripping through the ceiling on to his own floor.&nbsp; His imagination
translated every sound into a pat, pat, pat, and once or twice he thought
he had felt it dropping on to his counterpane, but he had never gone
upstairs to try and rescue poor Mrs Holt.&nbsp; Happily it had proved
next morning that Mrs Holt was in her usual health.</p>
<p>Ernest was in despair about hitting on any good way of opening up
spiritual communication with his neighbour, when it occurred to him
that he had better perhaps begin by going upstairs, and knocking very
gently at Mr Holt&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; He would then resign himself to
the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and act as the occasion, which, I suppose,
was another name for the Holy Spirit, suggested.&nbsp; Triply armed
with this reflection, he mounted the stairs quite jauntily, and was
about to knock when he heard Holt&rsquo;s voice inside swearing savagely
at his wife.&nbsp; This made him pause to think whether after all the
moment was an auspicious one, and while he was thus pausing, Mr Holt,
who had heard that someone was on the stairs, opened the door and put
his head out.&nbsp; When he saw Ernest, he made an unpleasant, not to
say offensive movement, which might or might not have been directed
at Ernest and looked altogether so ugly that my hero had an instantaneous
and unequivocal revelation from the Holy Spirit to the effect that he
should continue his journey upstairs at once, as though he had never
intended arresting it at Mr Holt&rsquo;s room, and begin by converting
Mr and Mrs Baxter, the Methodists in the top floor front.&nbsp; So this
was what he did.</p>
<p>These good people received him with open arms, and were quite ready
to talk.&nbsp; He was beginning to convert them from Methodism to the
Church of England, when all at once he found himself embarrassed by
discovering that he did not know what he was to convert them from.&nbsp;
He knew the Church of England, or thought he did, but he knew nothing
of Methodism beyond its name.&nbsp; When he found that, according to
Mr Baxter, the Wesleyans had a vigorous system of Church discipline
(which worked admirably in practice) it appeared to him that John Wesley
had anticipated the spiritual engine which he and Pryer were preparing,
and when he left the room he was aware that he had caught more of a
spiritual Tartar than he had expected.&nbsp; But he must certainly explain
to Pryer that the Wesleyans had a system of Church discipline.&nbsp;
This was very important.</p>
<p>Mr Baxter advised Ernest on no account to meddle with Mr Holt, and
Ernest was much relieved at the advice.&nbsp; If an opportunity arose
of touching the man&rsquo;s heart, he would take it; he would pat the
children on the head when he saw them on the stairs, and ingratiate
himself with them as far as he dared; they were sturdy youngsters, and
Ernest was afraid even of them, for they were ready with their tongues,
and knew much for their ages.&nbsp; Ernest felt that it would indeed
be almost better for him that a millstone should be hanged about his
neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of the
little Holts.&nbsp; However, he would try not to offend them; perhaps
an occasional penny or two might square them.&nbsp; This was as much
as he could do, for he saw that the attempt to be instant out of season,
as well as in season, would, St Paul&rsquo;s injunction notwithstanding,
end in failure.</p>
<p>Mrs Baxter gave a very bad account of Miss Emily Snow, who lodged
in the second floor back next to Mr Holt.&nbsp; Her story was quite
different from that of Mrs Jupp the landlady.&nbsp; She would doubtless
be only too glad to receive Ernest&rsquo;s ministrations or those of
any other gentleman, but she was no governess, she was in the ballet
at Drury Lane, and besides this, she was a very bad young woman, and
if Mrs Baxter was landlady would not be allowed to stay in the house
a single hour, not she indeed.</p>
<p>Miss Maitland in the next room to Mrs Baxter&rsquo;s own was a quiet
and respectable young woman to all appearance; Mrs Baxter had never
known of any goings on in that quarter, but, bless you, still waters
run deep, and these girls were all alike, one as bad as the other.&nbsp;
She was out at all kinds of hours, and when you knew that you knew all.</p>
<p>Ernest did not pay much heed to these aspersions of Mrs Baxter&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Mrs Jupp had got round the greater number of his many blind sides, and
had warned him not to believe Mrs Baxter, whose lip she said was something
awful.</p>
<p>Ernest had heard that women were always jealous of one another, and
certainly these young women were more attractive than Mrs Baxter was,
so jealousy was probably at the bottom of it.&nbsp; If they were maligned
there could be no objection to his making their acquaintance; if not
maligned they had all the more need of his ministrations.&nbsp; He would
reclaim them at once.</p>
<p>He told Mrs Jupp of his intention.&nbsp; Mrs Jupp at first tried
to dissuade him, but seeing him resolute, suggested that she should
herself see Miss Snow first, so as to prepare her and prevent her from
being alarmed by his visit.&nbsp; She was not at home now, but in the
course of the next day, it should be arranged.&nbsp; In the meantime
he had better try Mr Shaw, the tinker, in the front kitchen.&nbsp; Mrs
Baxter had told Ernest that Mr Shaw was from the North Country, and
an avowed freethinker; he would probably, she said, rather like a visit,
but she did not think Ernest would stand much chance of making a convert
of him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LIX</h2>
<p>Before going down into the kitchen to convert the tinker Ernest ran
hurriedly over his analysis of Paley&rsquo;s evidences, and put into
his pocket a copy of Archbishop Whateley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Historic Doubts.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then he descended the dark rotten old stairs and knocked at the tinker&rsquo;s
door.&nbsp; Mr Shaw was very civil; he said he was rather throng just
now, but if Ernest did not mind the sound of hammering he should be
very glad of a talk with him.&nbsp; Our hero, assenting to this, ere
long led the conversation to Whateley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Historic Doubts&rdquo;&mdash;a
work which, as the reader may know, pretends to show that there never
was any such person as Napoleon Buonaparte, and thus satirises the arguments
of those who have attacked the Christian miracles.</p>
<p>Mr Shaw said he knew &ldquo;Historic Doubts&rdquo; very well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what you think of it?&rdquo; said Ernest, who regarded
the pamphlet as a masterpiece of wit and cogency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you really want to know,&rdquo; said Mr Shaw, with a sly
twinkle, &ldquo;I think that he who was so willing and able to prove
that what was was not, would be equally able and willing to make a case
for thinking that what was not was, if it suited his purpose.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ernest was very much taken aback.&nbsp; How was it that all the clever
people of Cambridge had never put him up to this simple rejoinder?&nbsp;
The answer is easy: they did not develop it for the same reason that
a hen had never developed webbed feet&mdash;that is to say, because
they did not want to do so; but this was before the days of Evolution,
and Ernest could not as yet know anything of the great principle that
underlies it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; continued Mr Shaw, &ldquo;these writers all
get their living by writing in a certain way, and the more they write
in that way, the more they are likely to get on.&nbsp; You should not
call them dishonest for this any more than a judge should call a barrister
dishonest for earning his living by defending one in whose innocence
he does not seriously believe; but you should hear the barrister on
the other side before you decide upon the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was another facer.&nbsp; Ernest could only stammer that he had
endeavoured to examine these questions as carefully as he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think you have,&rdquo; said Mr Shaw; &ldquo;you Oxford
and Cambridge gentlemen think you have examined everything.&nbsp; I
have examined very little myself except the bottoms of old kettles and
saucepans, but if you will answer me a few questions, I will tell you
whether or no you have examined much more than I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest expressed his readiness to be questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the tinker, &ldquo;give me the story of
the Resurrection of Jesus Christ as told in St John&rsquo;s gospel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am sorry to say that Ernest mixed up the four accounts in a deplorable
manner; he even made the angel come down and roll away the stone and
sit upon it.&nbsp; He was covered with confusion when the tinker first
told him without the book of some of his many inaccuracies, and then
verified his criticisms by referring to the New Testament itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mr Shaw good naturedly, &ldquo;I am an old
man and you are a young one, so perhaps you&rsquo;ll not mind my giving
you a piece of advice.&nbsp; I like you, for I believe you mean well,
but you&rsquo;ve been real bad brought up, and I don&rsquo;t think you
have ever had so much as a chance yet.&nbsp; You know nothing of our
side of the question, and I have just shown you that you do not know
much more of your own, but I think you will make a kind of Carlyle sort
of a man some day.&nbsp; Now go upstairs and read the accounts of the
Resurrection correctly without mixing them up, and have a clear idea
of what it is that each writer tells us, then if you feel inclined to
pay me another visit I shall be glad to see you, for I shall know you
have made a good beginning and mean business.&nbsp; Till then, Sir,
I must wish you a very good morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest retreated abashed.&nbsp; An hour sufficed him to perform the
task enjoined upon him by Mr Shaw; and at the end of that hour the &ldquo;No,
no, no,&rdquo; which still sounded in his ears as he heard it from Towneley,
came ringing up more loudly still from the very pages of the Bible itself,
and in respect of the most important of all the events which are recorded
in it.&nbsp; Surely Ernest&rsquo;s first day&rsquo;s attempt at more
promiscuous visiting, and at carrying out his principles more thoroughly,
had not been unfruitful.&nbsp; But he must go and have a talk with Pryer.&nbsp;
He therefore got his lunch and went to Pryer&rsquo;s lodgings.&nbsp;
Pryer not being at home, he lounged to the British Museum Reading Room,
then recently opened, sent for the &ldquo;Vestiges of Creation,&rdquo;
which he had never yet seen, and spent the rest of the afternoon in
reading it.</p>
<p>Ernest did not see Pryer on the day of his conversation with Mr Shaw,
but he did so next morning and found him in a good temper, which of
late he had rarely been.&nbsp; Sometimes, indeed, he had behaved to
Ernest in a way which did not bode well for the harmony with which the
College of Spiritual Pathology would work when it had once been founded.&nbsp;
It almost seemed as though he were trying to get a complete moral ascendency
over him, so as to make him a creature of his own.</p>
<p>He did not think it possible that he could go too far, and indeed,
when I reflect upon my hero&rsquo;s folly and inexperience, there is
much to be said in excuse for the conclusion which Pryer came to.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, however, it was not so.&nbsp; Ernest&rsquo;s
faith in Pryer had been too great to be shaken down all in a moment,
but it had been weakened lately more than once.&nbsp; Ernest had fought
hard against allowing himself to see this, nevertheless any third person
who knew the pair would have been able to see that the connection between
the two might end at any moment, for when the time for one of Ernest&rsquo;s
snipe-like changes of flight came, he was quick in making it; the time,
however, was not yet come, and the intimacy between the two was apparently
all that it had ever been.&nbsp; It was only that horrid money business
(so said Ernest to himself) that caused any unpleasantness between them,
and no doubt Pryer was right, and he, Ernest, much too nervous.&nbsp;
However, that might stand over for the present.</p>
<p>In like manner, though he had received a shock by reason of his conversation
with Mr Shaw, and by looking at the &ldquo;Vestiges,&rdquo; he was as
yet too much stunned to realise the change which was coming over him.&nbsp;
In each case the momentum of old habits carried him forward in the old
direction.&nbsp; He therefore called on Pryer, and spent an hour and
more with him.</p>
<p>He did not say that he had been visiting among his neighbours; this
to Pryer would have been like a red rag to a bull.&nbsp; He only talked
in much his usual vein about the proposed College, the lamentable want
of interest in spiritual things which was characteristic of modern society,
and other kindred matters; he concluded by saying that for the present
he feared Pryer was indeed right, and that nothing could be done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As regards the laity,&rdquo; said Pryer, &ldquo;nothing; not
until we have a discipline which we can enforce with pains and penalties.&nbsp;
How can a sheep dog work a flock of sheep unless he can bite occasionally
as well as bark?&nbsp; But as regards ourselves we can do much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pryer&rsquo;s manner was strange throughout the conversation, as
though he were thinking all the time of something else.&nbsp; His eyes
wandered curiously over Ernest, as Ernest had often noticed them wander
before: the words were about Church discipline, but somehow or other
the discipline part of the story had a knack of dropping out after having
been again and again emphatically declared to apply to the laity and
not to the clergy: once indeed Pryer had pettishly exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh,
bother the College of Spiritual Pathology.&rdquo;&nbsp; As regards the
clergy, glimpses of a pretty large cloven hoof kept peeping out from
under the saintly robe of Pryer&rsquo;s conversation, to the effect,
that so long as they were theoretically perfect, practical peccadilloes&mdash;or
even peccadaccios, if there is such a word, were of less importance.&nbsp;
He was restless, as though wanting to approach a subject which he did
not quite venture to touch upon, and kept harping (he did this about
every third day) on the wretched lack of definition concerning the limits
of vice and virtue, and the way in which half the vices wanted regulating
rather than prohibiting.&nbsp; He dwelt also on the advantages of complete
unreserve, and hinted that there were mysteries into which Ernest had
not yet been initiated, but which would enlighten him when he got to
know them, as he would be allowed to do when his friends saw that he
was strong enough.</p>
<p>Pryer had often been like this before, but never so nearly, as it
seemed to Ernest, coming to a point&mdash;though what the point was
he could not fully understand.&nbsp; His inquietude was communicating
itself to Ernest, who would probably ere long have come to know as much
as Pryer could tell him, but the conversation was abruptly interrupted
by the appearance of a visitor.&nbsp; We shall never know how it would
have ended, for this was the very last time that Ernest ever saw Pryer.&nbsp;
Perhaps Pryer was going to break to him some bad news about his speculations.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LX</h2>
<p>Ernest now went home and occupied himself till luncheon with studying
Dean Alford&rsquo;s notes upon the various Evangelistic records of the
Resurrection, doing as Mr Shaw had told him, and trying to find out
not that they were all accurate, but whether they were all accurate
or no.&nbsp; He did not care which result he should arrive at, but he
was resolved that he would reach one or the other.&nbsp; When he had
finished Dean Alford&rsquo;s notes he found them come to this, namely,
that no one yet had succeeded in bringing the four accounts into tolerable
harmony with each other, and that the Dean, seeing no chance of succeeding
better than his predecessors had done, recommended that the whole story
should be taken on trust&mdash;and this Ernest was not prepared to do.</p>
<p>He got his luncheon, went out for a long walk, and returned to dinner
at half past six.&nbsp; While Mrs Jupp was getting him his dinner&mdash;a
steak and a pint of stout&mdash;she told him that Miss Snow would be
very happy to see him in about an hour&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; This disconcerted
him, for his mind was too unsettled for him to wish to convert anyone
just then.&nbsp; He reflected a little, and found that, in spite of
the sudden shock to his opinions, he was being irresistibly drawn to
pay the visit as though nothing had happened.&nbsp; It would not look
well for him not to go, for he was known to be in the house.&nbsp; He
ought not to be in too great a hurry to change his opinions on such
a matter as the evidence for Christ&rsquo;s Resurrection all of a sudden&mdash;besides
he need not talk to Miss Snow about this subject to-day&mdash;there
were other things he might talk about.&nbsp; What other things?&nbsp;
Ernest felt his heart beat fast and fiercely, and an inward monitor
warned him that he was thinking of anything rather than of Miss Snow&rsquo;s
soul.</p>
<p>What should he do?&nbsp; Fly, fly, fly&mdash;it was the only safety.&nbsp;
But would Christ have fled?&nbsp; Even though Christ had not died and
risen from the dead there could be no question that He was the model
whose example we were bound to follow.&nbsp; Christ would not have fled
from Miss Snow; he was sure of that, for He went about more especially
with prostitutes and disreputable people.&nbsp; Now, as then, it was
the business of the true Christian to call not the righteous but sinners
to repentance.&nbsp; It would be inconvenient to him to change his lodgings,
and he could not ask Mrs Jupp to turn Miss Snow and Miss Maitland out
of the house.&nbsp; Where was he to draw the line?&nbsp; Who would be
just good enough to live in the same house with him, and who just not
good enough?</p>
<p>Besides, where were these poor girls to go?&nbsp; Was he to drive
them from house to house till they had no place to lie in?&nbsp; It
was absurd; his duty was clear: he would go and see Miss Snow at once,
and try if he could not induce her to change her present mode of life;
if he found temptation becoming too strong for him he would fly then&mdash;so
he went upstairs with his Bible under his arm, and a consuming fire
in his heart.</p>
<p>He found Miss Snow looking very pretty in a neatly, not to say demurely,
furnished room.&nbsp; I think she had bought an illuminated text or
two, and pinned it up over her fireplace that morning.&nbsp; Ernest
was very much pleased with her, and mechanically placed his Bible upon
the table.&nbsp; He had just opened a timid conversation and was deep
in blushes, when a hurried step came bounding up the stairs as though
of one over whom the force of gravity had little power, and a man burst
into the room saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m come before my time.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was Towneley.</p>
<p>His face dropped as he caught sight of Ernest.&nbsp; &ldquo;What,
you here, Pontifex!&nbsp; Well, upon my word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cannot describe the hurried explanations that passed quickly between
the three&mdash;enough that in less than a minute Ernest, blushing more
scarlet than ever, slunk off, Bible and all, deeply humiliated as he
contrasted himself and Towneley.&nbsp; Before he had reached the bottom
of the staircase leading to his own room he heard Towneley&rsquo;s hearty
laugh through Miss Snow&rsquo;s door, and cursed the hour that he was
born.</p>
<p>Then it flashed upon him that if he could not see Miss Snow he could
at any rate see Miss Maitland.&nbsp; He knew well enough what he wanted
now, and as for the Bible, he pushed it from him to the other end of
his table.&nbsp; It fell over on to the floor, and he kicked it into
a corner.&nbsp; It was the Bible given him at his christening by his
affectionate aunt, Elizabeth Allaby.&nbsp; True, he knew very little
of Miss Maitland, but ignorant young fools in Ernest&rsquo;s state do
not reflect or reason closely.&nbsp; Mrs Baxter had said that Miss Maitland
and Miss Snow were birds of a feather, and Mrs Baxter probably knew
better than that old liar, Mrs Jupp.&nbsp; Shakespeare says:</p>
<blockquote><p>O Opportunity, thy guilt is great<br />
&rsquo;Tis thou that execut&rsquo;st the traitor&rsquo;s treason:<br />
Thou set&rsquo;st the wolf where he the lamb may get;<br />
Whoever plots the sin, thou &rsquo;point&rsquo;st the season;<br />
&rsquo;Tis thou that spurn&rsquo;st at right, at law, at reason;<br />
And in thy shady cell, where none may spy him,<br />
Sits Sin, to seize the souls that wander by him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the guilt of opportunity is great, how much greater is the guilt
of that which is believed to be opportunity, but in reality is no opportunity
at all.&nbsp; If the better part of valour is discretion, how much more
is not discretion the better part of vice</p>
<p>About ten minutes after we last saw Ernest, a scared, insulted girl,
flushed and trembling, was seen hurrying from Mrs Jupp&rsquo;s house
as fast as her agitated state would let her, and in another ten minutes
two policemen were seen also coming out of Mrs Jupp&rsquo;s, between
whom there shambled rather than walked our unhappy friend Ernest, with
staring eyes, ghastly pale, and with despair branded upon every line
of his face.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXI</h2>
<p>Pryer had done well to warn Ernest against promiscuous house to house
visitation.&nbsp; He had not gone outside Mrs Jupp&rsquo;s street door,
and yet what had been the result?</p>
<p>Mr Holt had put him in bodily fear; Mr and Mrs Baxter had nearly
made a Methodist of him; Mr Shaw had undermined his faith in the Resurrection;
Miss Snow&rsquo;s charms had ruined&mdash;or would have done so but
for an accident&mdash;his moral character.&nbsp; As for Miss Maitland,
he had done his best to ruin hers, and had damaged himself gravely and
irretrievably in consequence.&nbsp; The only lodger who had done him
no harm was the bellows&rsquo; mender, whom he had not visited.</p>
<p>Other young clergymen, much greater fools in many respects than he,
would not have got into these scrapes.&nbsp; He seemed to have developed
an aptitude for mischief almost from the day of his having been ordained.&nbsp;
He could hardly preach without making some horrid <i>faux pas</i>.&nbsp;
He preached one Sunday morning when the Bishop was at his Rector&rsquo;s
church, and made his sermon turn upon the question what kind of little
cake it was that the widow of Zarephath had intended making when Elijah
found her gathering a few sticks.&nbsp; He demonstrated that it was
a seed cake.&nbsp; The sermon was really very amusing, and more than
once he saw a smile pass over the sea of faces underneath him.&nbsp;
The Bishop was very angry, and gave my hero a severe reprimand in the
vestry after service was over; the only excuse he could make was that
he was preaching <i>ex tempore</i>, had not thought of this particular
point till he was actually in the pulpit, and had then been carried
away by it.</p>
<p>Another time he preached upon the barren fig-tree, and described
the hopes of the owner as he watched the delicate blossom unfold, and
give promise of such beautiful fruit in autumn.&nbsp; Next day he received
a letter from a botanical member of his congregation who explained to
him that this could hardly have been, inasmuch as the fig produces its
fruit first and blossoms inside the fruit, or so nearly so that no flower
is perceptible to an ordinary observer.&nbsp; This last, however, was
an accident which might have happened to any one but a scientist or
an inspired writer.</p>
<p>The only excuse I can make for him is that he was very young&mdash;not
yet four and twenty&mdash;and that in mind as in body, like most of
those who in the end come to think for themselves, he was a slow grower.&nbsp;
By far the greater part, moreover, of his education had been an attempt,
not so much to keep him in blinkers as to gouge his eyes out altogether.</p>
<p>But to return to my story.&nbsp; It transpired afterwards that Miss
Maitland had had no intention of giving Ernest in charge when she ran
out of Mrs Jupp&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; She was running away because she
was frightened, but almost the first person whom she ran against had
happened to be a policeman of a serious turn of mind, who wished to
gain a reputation for activity.&nbsp; He stopped her, questioned her,
frightened her still more, and it was he rather than Miss Maitland,
who insisted on giving my hero in charge to himself and another constable.</p>
<p>Towneley was still in Mrs Jupp&rsquo;s house when the policeman came.&nbsp;
He had heard a disturbance, and going down to Ernest&rsquo;s room while
Miss Maitland was out of doors, had found him lying, as it were, stunned
at the foot of the moral precipice over which he had that moment fallen.&nbsp;
He saw the whole thing at a glance, but before he could take action,
the policemen came in and action became impossible.</p>
<p>He asked Ernest who were his friends in London.&nbsp; Ernest at first
wanted not to say, but Towneley soon gave him to understand that he
must do as he was bid, and selected myself from the few whom he had
named.&nbsp; &ldquo;Writes for the stage, does he?&rdquo; said Towneley.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Does he write comedy?&rdquo;&nbsp; Ernest thought Towneley meant
that I ought to write tragedy, and said he was afraid I wrote burlesque.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, come, come,&rdquo; said Towneley, &ldquo;that will do famously.&nbsp;
I will go and see him at once.&rdquo;&nbsp; But on second thoughts he
determined to stay with Ernest and go with him to the police court.&nbsp;
So he sent Mrs Jupp for me.&nbsp; Mrs Jupp hurried so fast to fetch
me, that in spite of the weather&rsquo;s being still cold she was &ldquo;giving
out,&rdquo; as she expressed it, in streams.&nbsp; The poor old wretch
would have taken a cab, but she had no money and did not like to ask
Towneley to give her some.&nbsp; I saw that something very serious had
happened, but was not prepared for anything so deplorable as what Mrs
Jupp actually told me.&nbsp; As for Mrs Jupp, she said her heart had
been jumping out of its socket and back again ever since.</p>
<p>I got her into a cab with me, and we went off to the police station.&nbsp;
She talked without ceasing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if the neighbours do say cruel things about me, I&rsquo;m
sure it ain&rsquo;t no thanks to <i>him</i> if they&rsquo;re true.&nbsp;
Mr Pontifex never took a bit o&rsquo; notice of me no more than if I
had been his sister.&nbsp; Oh, it&rsquo;s enough to make anyone&rsquo;s
back bone curdle.&nbsp; Then I thought perhaps my Rose might get on
better with him, so I set her to dust him and clean him as though I
were busy, and gave her such a beautiful clean new pinny, but he never
took no notice of her no more than he did of me, and she didn&rsquo;t
want no compliment neither, she wouldn&rsquo;t have taken not a shilling
from him, though he had offered it, but he didn&rsquo;t seem to know
anything at all.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t make out what the young men are
a-coming to; I wish the horn may blow for me and the worms take me this
very night, if it&rsquo;s not enough to make a woman stand before God
and strike the one half on &rsquo;em silly to see the way they goes
on, and many an honest girl has to go home night after night without
so much as a fourpenny bit and paying three and sixpence a week rent,
and not a shelf nor cupboard in the place and a dead wall in front of
the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Mr Pontifex,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
so bad, he&rsquo;s good at heart.&nbsp; He never says nothing unkind.&nbsp;
And then there&rsquo;s his dear eyes&mdash;but when I speak about that
to my Rose she calls me an old fool and says I ought to be poleaxed.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s that Pryer as I can&rsquo;t abide.&nbsp; Oh he!&nbsp; He
likes to wound a woman&rsquo;s feelings he do, and to chuck anything
in her face, he do&mdash;he likes to wind a woman up and to wound her
down.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Mrs Jupp pronounced &ldquo;wound&rdquo; as though
it rhymed to &ldquo;sound.&rdquo;)&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a gentleman&rsquo;s
place to soothe a woman, but he, he&rsquo;d like to tear her hair out
by handfuls.&nbsp; Why, he told me to my face that I was a-getting old;
old indeed! there&rsquo;s not a woman in London knows my age except
Mrs Davis down in the Old Kent Road, and beyond a haricot vein in one
of my legs I&rsquo;m as young as ever I was.&nbsp; Old indeed!&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s many a good tune played on an old fiddle.&nbsp; I hate
his nasty insinuendos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even if I had wanted to stop her, I could not have done so.&nbsp;
She said a great deal more than I have given above.&nbsp; I have left
out much because I could not remember it, but still more because it
was really impossible for me to print it.</p>
<p>When we got to the police station I found Towneley and Ernest already
there.&nbsp; The charge was one of assault, but not aggravated by serious
violence.&nbsp; Even so, however, it was lamentable enough, and we both
saw that our young friend would have to pay dearly for his inexperience.&nbsp;
We tried to bail him out for the night, but the Inspector would not
accept bail, so we were forced to leave him.</p>
<p>Towneley then went back to Mrs Jupp&rsquo;s to see if he could find
Miss Maitland and arrange matters with her.&nbsp; She was not there,
but he traced her to the house of her father, who lived at Camberwell.&nbsp;
The father was furious and would not hear of any intercession on Towneley&rsquo;s
part.&nbsp; He was a Dissenter, and glad to make the most of any scandal
against a clergyman; Towneley, therefore, was obliged to return unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Next morning, Towneley&mdash;who regarded Ernest as a drowning man,
who must be picked out of the water somehow or other if possible, irrespective
of the way in which he got into it&mdash;called on me, and we put the
matter into the hands of one of the best known attorneys of the day.&nbsp;
I was greatly pleased with Towneley, and thought it due to him to tell
him what I had told no one else.&nbsp; I mean that Ernest would come
into his aunt&rsquo;s money in a few years&rsquo; time, and would therefore
then be rich.</p>
<p>Towneley was doing all he could before this, but I knew that the
knowledge I had imparted to him would make him feel as though Ernest
was more one of his own class, and had therefore a greater claim upon
his good offices.&nbsp; As for Ernest himself, his gratitude was greater
than could be expressed in words.&nbsp; I have heard him say that he
can call to mind many moments, each one of which might well pass for
the happiest of his life, but that this night stands clearly out as
the most painful that he ever passed, yet so kind and considerate was
Towneley that it was quite bearable.</p>
<p>But with all the best wishes in the world neither Towneley nor I
could do much to help beyond giving our moral support.&nbsp; Our attorney
told us that the magistrate before whom Ernest would appear was very
severe on cases of this description, and that the fact of his being
a clergyman would tell against him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ask for no remand,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and make no defence.&nbsp; We will call Mr Pontifex&rsquo;s
rector and you two gentlemen as witnesses for previous good character.&nbsp;
These will be enough.&nbsp; Let us then make a profound apology and
beg the magistrate to deal with the case summarily instead of sending
it for trial.&nbsp; If you can get this, believe me, your young friend
will be better out of it than he has any right to expect.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXII</h2>
<p>This advice, besides being obviously sensible, would end in saving
Ernest both time and suspense of mind, so we had no hesitation in adopting
it.&nbsp; The case was called on about eleven o&rsquo;clock, but we
got it adjourned till three, so as to give time for Ernest to set his
affairs as straight as he could, and to execute a power of attorney
enabling me to act for him as I should think fit while he was in prison.</p>
<p>Then all came out about Pryer and the College of Spiritual Pathology.&nbsp;
Ernest had even greater difficulty in making a clean breast of this
than he had had in telling us about Miss Maitland, but he told us all,
and the upshot was that he had actually handed over to Pryer every halfpenny
that he then possessed with no other security than Pryer&rsquo;s I.O.U.&rsquo;s
for the amount.&nbsp; Ernest, though still declining to believe that
Pryer could be guilty of dishonourable conduct, was becoming alive to
the folly of what he had been doing; he still made sure, however, of
recovering, at any rate, the greater part of his property as soon as
Pryer should have had time to sell.&nbsp; Towneley and I were of a different
opinion, but we did not say what we thought.</p>
<p>It was dreary work waiting all the morning amid such unfamiliar and
depressing surroundings.&nbsp; I thought how the Psalmist had exclaimed
with quiet irony, &ldquo;One day in thy courts is better than a thousand,&rdquo;
and I thought that I could utter a very similar sentiment in respect
of the Courts in which Towneley and I were compelled to loiter.&nbsp;
At last, about three o&rsquo;clock the case was called on, and we went
round to the part of the court which is reserved for the general public,
while Ernest was taken into the prisoner&rsquo;s dock.&nbsp; As soon
as he had collected himself sufficiently he recognised the magistrate
as the old gentleman who had spoken to him in the train on the day he
was leaving school, and saw, or thought he saw, to his great grief,
that he too was recognised.</p>
<p>Mr Ottery, for this was our attorney&rsquo;s name, took the line
he had proposed.&nbsp; He called no other witnesses than the rector,
Towneley and myself, and threw himself on the mercy of the magistrate.&nbsp;
When he had concluded, the magistrate spoke as follows: &ldquo;Ernest
Pontifex, yours is one of the most painful cases that I have ever had
to deal with.&nbsp; You have been singularly favoured in your parentage
and education.&nbsp; You have had before you the example of blameless
parents, who doubtless instilled into you from childhood the enormity
of the offence which by your own confession you have committed.&nbsp;
You were sent to one of the best public schools in England.&nbsp; It
is not likely that in the healthy atmosphere of such a school as Roughborough
you can have come across contaminating influences; you were probably,
I may say certainly, impressed at school with the heinousness of any
attempt to depart from the strictest chastity until such time as you
had entered into a state of matrimony.&nbsp; At Cambridge you were shielded
from impurity by every obstacle which virtuous and vigilant authorities
could devise, and even had the obstacles been fewer, your parents probably
took care that your means should not admit of your throwing money away
upon abandoned characters.&nbsp; At night proctors patrolled the street
and dogged your steps if you tried to go into any haunt where the presence
of vice was suspected.&nbsp; By day the females who were admitted within
the college walls were selected mainly on the score of age and ugliness.&nbsp;
It is hard to see what more can be done for any young man than this.&nbsp;
For the last four or five months you have been a clergyman, and if a
single impure thought had still remained within your mind, ordination
should have removed it: nevertheless, not only does it appear that your
mind is as impure as though none of the influences to which I have referred
had been brought to bear upon it, but it seems as though their only
result had been this&mdash;that you have not even the common sense to
be able to distinguish between a respectable girl and a prostitute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were to take a strict view of my duty I should commit
you for trial, but in consideration of this being your first offence,
I shall deal leniently with you and sentence you to imprisonment with
hard labour for six calendar months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Towneley and I both thought there was a touch of irony in the magistrate&rsquo;s
speech, and that he could have given a lighter sentence if he would,
but that was neither here nor there.&nbsp; We obtained leave to see
Ernest for a few minutes before he was removed to Coldbath Fields, where
he was to serve his term, and found him so thankful to have been summarily
dealt with that he hardly seemed to care about the miserable plight
in which he was to pass the next six months.&nbsp; When he came out,
he said, he would take what remained of his money, go off to America
or Australia and never be heard of more.</p>
<p>We left him full of this resolve, I, to write to Theobald, and also
to instruct my solicitor to get Ernest&rsquo;s money out of Pryer&rsquo;s
hands, and Towneley to see the reporters and keep the case out of the
newspapers.&nbsp; He was successful as regards all the higher-class
papers.&nbsp; There was only one journal, and that of the lowest class,
which was incorruptible.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXIII</h2>
<p>I saw my solicitor at once, but when I tried to write to Theobald,
I found it better to say I would run down and see him.&nbsp; I therefore
proposed this, asking him to meet me at the station, and hinting that
I must bring bad news about his son.&nbsp; I knew he would not get my
letter more than a couple of hours before I should see him, and thought
the short interval of suspense might break the shock of what I had to
say.</p>
<p>Never do I remember to have halted more between two opinions than
on my journey to Battersby upon this unhappy errand.&nbsp; When I thought
of the little sallow-faced lad whom I had remembered years before, of
the long and savage cruelty with which he had been treated in childhood&mdash;cruelty
none the less real for having been due to ignorance and stupidity rather
than to deliberate malice; of the atmosphere of lying and self-laudatory
hallucination in which he had been brought up; of the readiness the
boy had shown to love anything that would be good enough to let him,
and of how affection for his parents, unless I am much mistaken, had
only died in him because it had been killed anew, again and again and
again, each time that it had tried to spring.&nbsp; When I thought of
all this I felt as though, if the matter had rested with me, I would
have sentenced Theobald and Christina to mental suffering even more
severe than that which was about to fall upon them.&nbsp; But on the
other hand, when I thought of Theobald&rsquo;s own childhood, of that
dreadful old George Pontifex his father, of John and Mrs John, and of
his two sisters, when again I thought of Christina&rsquo;s long years
of hope deferred that maketh the heart sick, before she was married,
of the life she must have led at Crampsford, and of the surroundings
in the midst of which she and her husband both lived at Battersby, I
felt as though the wonder was that misfortunes so persistent had not
been followed by even graver retribution.</p>
<p>Poor people!&nbsp; They had tried to keep their ignorance of the
world from themselves by calling it the pursuit of heavenly things,
and then shutting their eyes to anything that might give them trouble.&nbsp;
A son having been born to them they had shut his eyes also as far as
was practicable.&nbsp; Who could blame them?&nbsp; They had chapter
and verse for everything they had either done or left undone; there
is no better thumbed precedent than that for being a clergyman and a
clergyman&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; In what respect had they differed from
their neighbours?&nbsp; How did their household differ from that of
any other clergyman of the better sort from one end of England to the
other?&nbsp; Why then should it have been upon them, of all people in
the world, that this tower of Siloam had fallen?</p>
<p>Surely it was the tower of Siloam that was naught rather than those
who stood under it; it was the system rather than the people that was
at fault.&nbsp; If Theobald and his wife had but known more of the world
and of the things that are therein, they would have done little harm
to anyone.&nbsp; Selfish they would have always been, but not more so
than may very well be pardoned, and not more than other people would
be.&nbsp; As it was, the case was hopeless; it would be no use their
even entering into their mothers&rsquo; wombs and being born again.&nbsp;
They must not only be born again but they must be born again each one
of them of a new father and of a new mother and of a different line
of ancestry for many generations before their minds could become supple
enough to learn anew.&nbsp; The only thing to do with them was to humour
them and make the best of them till they died&mdash;and be thankful
when they did so.</p>
<p>Theobald got my letter as I had expected, and met me at the station
nearest to Battersby.&nbsp; As I walked back with him towards his own
house I broke the news to him as gently as I could.&nbsp; I pretended
that the whole thing was in great measure a mistake, and that though
Ernest no doubt had had intentions which he ought to have resisted,
he had not meant going anything like the length which Miss Maitland
supposed.&nbsp; I said we had felt how much appearances were against
him, and had not dared to set up this defence before the magistrate,
though we had no doubt about its being the true one.</p>
<p>Theobald acted with a readier and acuter moral sense than I had given
him credit for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have nothing more to do with him,&rdquo; he exclaimed
promptly, &ldquo;I will never see his face again; do not let him write
either to me or to his mother; we know of no such person.&nbsp; Tell
him you have seen me, and that from this day forward I shall put him
out of my mind as though he had never been born.&nbsp; I have been a
good father to him, and his mother idolised him; selfishness and ingratitude
have been the only return we have ever had from him; my hope henceforth
must be in my remaining children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told him how Ernest&rsquo;s fellow curate had got hold of his money,
and hinted that he might very likely be penniless, or nearly so, on
leaving prison.&nbsp; Theobald did not seem displeased at this, but
added soon afterwards: &ldquo;If this proves to be the case, tell him
from me that I will give him a hundred pounds if he will tell me through
you when he will have it paid, but tell him not to write and thank me,
and say that if he attempts to open up direct communication either with
his mother or myself, he shall not have a penny of the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing what I knew, and having determined on violating Miss Pontifex&rsquo;s
instructions should the occasion arise, I did not think Ernest would
be any the worse for a complete estrangement from his family, so I acquiesced
more readily in what Theobald had proposed than that gentleman may have
expected.</p>
<p>Thinking it better that I should not see Christina, I left Theobald
near Battersby and walked back to the station.&nbsp; On my way I was
pleased to reflect that Ernest&rsquo;s father was less of a fool than
I had taken him to be, and had the greater hopes, therefore, that his
son&rsquo;s blunders might be due to postnatal, rather than congenital
misfortunes.&nbsp; Accidents which happen to a man before he is born,
in the persons of his ancestors, will, if he remembers them at all,
leave an indelible impression on him; they will have moulded his character
so that, do what he will, it is hardly possible for him to escape their
consequences.&nbsp; If a man is to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,
he must do so, not only as a little child, but as a little embryo, or
rather as a little zoosperm&mdash;and not only this, but as one that
has come of zoosperms which have entered into the Kingdom of Heaven
before him for many generations.&nbsp; Accidents which occur for the
first time, and belong to the period since a man&rsquo;s last birth,
are not, as a general rule, so permanent in their effects, though of
course they may sometimes be so.&nbsp; At any rate, I was not displeased
at the view which Ernest&rsquo;s father took of the situation.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXIV</h2>
<p>After Ernest had been sentenced, he was taken back to the cells to
wait for the van which should take him to Coldbath Fields, where he
was to serve his term.</p>
<p>He was still too stunned and dazed by the suddenness with which events
had happened during the last twenty-four hours to be able to realise
his position.&nbsp; A great chasm had opened between his past and future;
nevertheless he breathed, his pulse beat, he could think and speak.&nbsp;
It seemed to him that he ought to be prostrated by the blow that had
fallen on him, but he was not prostrated; he had suffered from many
smaller laches far more acutely.&nbsp; It was not until he thought of
the pain his disgrace would inflict on his father and mother that he
felt how readily he would have given up all he had, rather than have
fallen into his present plight.&nbsp; It would break his mother&rsquo;s
heart.&nbsp; It must, he knew it would&mdash;and it was he who had done
this.</p>
<p>He had had a headache coming on all the forenoon, but as he thought
of his father and mother, his pulse quickened, and the pain in his head
suddenly became intense.&nbsp; He could hardly walk to the van, and
he found its motion insupportable.&nbsp; On reaching the prison he was
too ill to walk without assistance across the hall to the corridor or
gallery where prisoners are marshalled on their arrival.&nbsp; The prison
warder, seeing at once that he was a clergyman, did not suppose he was
shamming, as he might have done in the case of an old gaol-bird; he
therefore sent for the doctor.&nbsp; When this gentleman arrived, Ernest
was declared to be suffering from an incipient attack of brain fever,
and was taken away to the infirmary.&nbsp; Here he hovered for the next
two months between life and death, never in full possession of his reason
and often delirious, but at last, contrary to the expectation of both
doctor and nurse, he began slowly to recover.</p>
<p>It is said that those who have been nearly drowned, find the return
to consciousness much more painful than the loss of it had been, and
so it was with my hero.&nbsp; As he lay helpless and feeble, it seemed
to him a refinement of cruelty that he had not died once for all during
his delirium.&nbsp; He thought he should still most likely recover only
to sink a little later on from shame and sorrow; nevertheless from day
to day he mended, though so slowly that he could hardly realise it to
himself.&nbsp; One afternoon, however, about three weeks after he had
regained consciousness, the nurse who tended him, and who had been very
kind to him, made some little rallying sally which amused him; he laughed,
and as he did so, she clapped her hands and told him he would be a man
again.&nbsp; The spark of hope was kindled, and again he wished to live.&nbsp;
Almost from that moment his thoughts began to turn less to the horrors
of the past, and more to the best way of meeting the future.</p>
<p>His worst pain was on behalf of his father and mother, and how he
should again face them.&nbsp; It still seemed to him that the best thing
both for him and them would be that he should sever himself from them
completely, take whatever money he could recover from Pryer, and go
to some place in the uttermost parts of the earth, where he should never
meet anyone who had known him at school or college, and start afresh.&nbsp;
Or perhaps he might go to the gold fields in California or Australia,
of which such wonderful accounts were then heard; there he might even
make his fortune, and return as an old man many years hence, unknown
to everyone, and if so, he would live at Cambridge.&nbsp; As he built
these castles in the air, the spark of life became a flame, and he longed
for health, and for the freedom which, now that so much of his sentence
had expired, was not after all very far distant.</p>
<p>Then things began to shape themselves more definitely.&nbsp; Whatever
happened he would be a clergyman no longer.&nbsp; It would have been
practically impossible for him to have found another curacy, even if
he had been so minded, but he was not so minded.&nbsp; He hated the
life he had been leading ever since he had begun to read for orders;
he could not argue about it, but simply he loathed it and would have
no more of it.&nbsp; As he dwelt on the prospect of becoming a layman
again, however disgraced, he rejoiced at what had befallen him, and
found a blessing in this very imprisonment which had at first seemed
such an unspeakable misfortune.</p>
<p>Perhaps the shock of so great a change in his surroundings had accelerated
changes in his opinions, just as the cocoons of silkworms, when sent
in baskets by rail, hatch before their time through the novelty of heat
and jolting.&nbsp; But however this may be, his belief in the stories
concerning the Death, Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus Christ, and
hence his faith in all the other Christian miracles, had dropped off
him once and for ever.&nbsp; The investigation he had made in consequence
of Mr Shaw&rsquo;s rebuke, hurried though it was, had left a deep impression
upon him, and now he was well enough to read he made the New Testament
his chief study, going through it in the spirit which Mr Shaw had desired
of him, that is to say as one who wished neither to believe nor disbelieve,
but cared only about finding out whether he ought to believe or no.&nbsp;
The more he read in this spirit the more the balance seemed to lie in
favour of unbelief, till, in the end, all further doubt became impossible,
and he saw plainly enough that, whatever else might be true, the story
that Christ had died, come to life again, and been carried from earth
through clouds into the heavens could not now be accepted by unbiassed
people.&nbsp; It was well he had found it out so soon.&nbsp; In one
way or another it was sure to meet him sooner or later.&nbsp; He would
probably have seen it years ago if he had not been hoodwinked by people
who were paid for hoodwinking him.&nbsp; What should he have done, he
asked himself, if he had not made his present discovery till years later
when he was more deeply committed to the life of a clergyman?&nbsp;
Should he have had the courage to face it, or would he not more probably
have evolved some excellent reason for continuing to think as he had
thought hitherto?&nbsp; Should he have had the courage to break away
even from his present curacy?</p>
<p>He thought not, and knew not whether to be more thankful for having
been shown his error or for having been caught up and twisted round
so that he could hardly err farther, almost at the very moment of his
having discovered it.&nbsp; The price he had had to pay for this boon
was light as compared with the boon itself.&nbsp; What is too heavy
a price to pay for having duty made at once clear and easy of fulfilment
instead of very difficult?&nbsp; He was sorry for his father and mother,
and he was sorry for Miss Maitland, but he was no longer sorry for himself.</p>
<p>It puzzled him, however, that he should not have known how much he
had hated being a clergyman till now.&nbsp; He knew that he did not
particularly like it, but if anyone had asked him whether he actually
hated it, he would have answered no.&nbsp; I suppose people almost always
want something external to themselves, to reveal to them their own likes
and dislikes.&nbsp; Our most assured likings have for the most part
been arrived at neither by introspection nor by any process of conscious
reasoning, but by the bounding forth of the heart to welcome the gospel
proclaimed to it by another.&nbsp; We hear some say that such and such
a thing is thus or thus, and in a moment the train that has been laid
within us, but whose presence we knew not, flashes into consciousness
and perception.</p>
<p>Only a year ago he had bounded forth to welcome Mr Hawke&rsquo;s
sermon; since then he had bounded after a College of Spiritual Pathology;
now he was in full cry after rationalism pure and simple; how could
he be sure that his present state of mind would be more lasting than
his previous ones?&nbsp; He could not be certain, but he felt as though
he were now on firmer ground than he had ever been before, and no matter
how fleeting his present opinions might prove to be, he could not but
act according to them till he saw reason to change them.&nbsp; How impossible,
he reflected, it would have been for him to do this, if he had remained
surrounded by people like his father and mother, or Pryer and Pryer&rsquo;s
friends, and his rector.&nbsp; He had been observing, reflecting, and
assimilating all these months with no more consciousness of mental growth
than a school-boy has of growth of body, but should he have been able
to admit his growth to himself, and to act up to his increased strength
if he had remained in constant close connection with people who assured
him solemnly that he was under a hallucination?&nbsp; The combination
against him was greater than his unaided strength could have broken
through, and he felt doubtful how far any shock less severe than the
one from which he was suffering would have sufficed to free him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXV</h2>
<p>As he lay on his bed day after day slowly recovering he woke up to
the fact which most men arrive at sooner or later, I mean that very
few care two straws about truth, or have any confidence that it is righter
and better to believe what is true than what is untrue, even though
belief in the untruth may seem at first sight most expedient.&nbsp;
Yet it is only these few who can be said to believe anything at all;
the rest are simply unbelievers in disguise.&nbsp; Perhaps, after all,
these last are right.&nbsp; They have numbers and prosperity on their
side.&nbsp; They have all which the rationalist appeals to as his tests
of right and wrong.&nbsp; Right, according to him, is what seems right
to the majority of sensible, well-to-do people; we know of no safer
criterion than this, but what does the decision thus arrived at involve?&nbsp;
Simply this, that a conspiracy of silence about things whose truth would
be immediately apparent to disinterested enquirers is not only tolerable
but righteous on the part of those who profess to be and take money
for being <i>par excellence</i> guardians and teachers of truth.</p>
<p>Ernest saw no logical escape from this conclusion.&nbsp; He saw that
belief on the part of the early Christians in the miraculous nature
of Christ&rsquo;s Resurrection was explicable, without any supposition
of miracle.&nbsp; The explanation lay under the eyes of anyone who chose
to take a moderate degree of trouble; it had been put before the world
again and again, and there had been no serious attempt to refute it.&nbsp;
How was it that Dean Alford for example who had made the New Testament
his speciality, could not or would not see what was so obvious to Ernest
himself?&nbsp; Could it be for any other reason than that he did not
want to see it, and if so was he not a traitor to the cause of truth?&nbsp;
Yes, but was he not also a respectable and successful man, and were
not the vast majority of respectable and successful men, such for example,
as all the bishops and archbishops, doing exactly as Dean Alford did,
and did not this make their action right, no matter though it had been
cannibalism or infanticide, or even habitual untruthfulness of mind?</p>
<p>Monstrous, odious falsehood!&nbsp; Ernest&rsquo;s feeble pulse quickened
and his pale face flushed as this hateful view of life presented itself
to him in all its logical consistency.&nbsp; It was not the fact of
most men being liars that shocked him&mdash;that was all right enough;
but even the momentary doubt whether the few who were not liars ought
not to become liars too.&nbsp; There was no hope left if this were so;
if this were so, let him die, the sooner the better.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo;
he exclaimed inwardly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe one word of it.&nbsp;
Strengthen Thou and confirm my disbelief.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seemed to
him that he could never henceforth see a bishop going to consecration
without saying to himself: &ldquo;There, but for the grace of God, went
Ernest Pontifex.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was no doing of his.&nbsp; He could
not boast; if he had lived in the time of Christ he might himself have
been an early Christian, or even an Apostle for aught he knew.&nbsp;
On the whole he felt that he had much to be thankful for.</p>
<p>The conclusion, then, that it might be better to believe error than
truth should be ordered out of court at once, no matter by how clear
a logic it had been arrived at; but what was the alternative?&nbsp;
It was this, that our criterion of truth&mdash;i.e. that truth is what
commends itself to the great majority of sensible and successful people&mdash;is
not infallible.&nbsp; The rule is sound, and covers by far the greater
number of cases, but it has its exceptions.</p>
<p>He asked himself, what were they?&nbsp; Ah! that was a difficult
matter; there were so many, and the rules which governed them were sometimes
so subtle, that mistakes always had and always would be made; it was
just this that made it impossible to reduce life to an exact science.&nbsp;
There was a rough and ready rule-of-thumb test of truth, and a number
of rules as regards exceptions which could be mastered without much
trouble, yet there was a residue of cases in which decision was difficult&mdash;so
difficult that a man had better follow his instinct than attempt to
decide them by any process of reasoning.</p>
<p>Instinct then is the ultimate court of appeal.&nbsp; And what is
instinct?&nbsp; It is a mode of faith in the evidence of things not
actually seen.&nbsp; And so my hero returned almost to the point from
which he had started originally, namely that the just shall live by
faith.</p>
<p>And this is what the just&mdash;that is to say reasonable people&mdash;do
as regards those daily affairs of life which most concern them.&nbsp;
They settle smaller matters by the exercise of their own deliberation.&nbsp;
More important ones, such as the cure of their own bodies and the bodies
of those whom they love, the investment of their money, the extrication
of their affairs from any serious mess&mdash;these things they generally
entrust to others of whose capacity they know little save from general
report; they act therefore on the strength of faith, not of knowledge.&nbsp;
So the English nation entrusts the welfare of its fleet and naval defences
to a First Lord of the Admiralty, who, not being a sailor can know nothing
about these matters except by acts of faith.&nbsp; There can be no doubt
about faith and not reason being the <i>ultima ratio</i>.</p>
<p>Even Euclid, who has laid himself as little open to the charge of
credulity as any writer who ever lived, cannot get beyond this.&nbsp;
He has no demonstrable first premise.&nbsp; He requires postulates and
axioms which transcend demonstration, and without which he can do nothing.&nbsp;
His superstructure indeed is demonstration, but his ground is faith.&nbsp;
Nor again can he get further than telling a man he is a fool if he persists
in differing from him.&nbsp; He says &ldquo;which is absurd,&rdquo;
and declines to discuss the matter further.&nbsp; Faith and authority,
therefore, prove to be as necessary for him as for anyone else.&nbsp;
&ldquo;By faith in what, then,&rdquo; asked Ernest of himself, &ldquo;shall
a just man endeavour to live at this present time?&rdquo;&nbsp; He answered
to himself, &ldquo;At any rate not by faith in the supernatural element
of the Christian religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And how should he best persuade his fellow-countrymen to leave off
believing in this supernatural element?&nbsp; Looking at the matter
from a practical point of view he thought the Archbishop of Canterbury
afforded the most promising key to the situation.&nbsp; It lay between
him and the Pope.&nbsp; The Pope was perhaps best in theory, but in
practice the Archbishop of Canterbury would do sufficiently well.&nbsp;
If he could only manage to sprinkle a pinch of salt, as it were, on
the Archbishop&rsquo;s tail, he might convert the whole Church of England
to free thought by a <i>coup de main</i>.&nbsp; There must be an amount
of cogency which even an Archbishop&mdash;an Archbishop whose perceptions
had never been quickened by imprisonment for assault&mdash;would not
be able to withstand.&nbsp; When brought face to face with the facts,
as he, Ernest, could arrange them; his Grace would have no resource
but to admit them; being an honourable man he would at once resign his
Archbishopric, and Christianity would become extinct in England within
a few months&rsquo; time.&nbsp; This, at any rate, was how things ought
to be.&nbsp; But all the time Ernest had no confidence in the Archbishop&rsquo;s
not hopping off just as the pinch was about to fall on him, and this
seemed so unfair that his blood boiled at the thought of it.&nbsp; If
this was to be so, he must try if he could not fix him by the judicious
use of bird-lime or a snare, or throw the salt on his tail from an ambuscade.</p>
<p>To do him justice it was not himself that he greatly cared about.&nbsp;
He knew he had been humbugged, and he knew also that the greater part
of the ills which had afflicted him were due, indirectly, in chief measure
to the influence of Christian teaching; still, if the mischief had ended
with himself, he should have thought little about it, but there was
his sister, and his brother Joey, and the hundreds and thousands of
young people throughout England whose lives were being blighted through
the lies told them by people whose business it was to know better, but
who scamped their work and shirked difficulties instead of facing them.&nbsp;
It was this which made him think it worth while to be angry, and to
consider whether he could not at least do something towards saving others
from such years of waste and misery as he had had to pass himself.&nbsp;
If there was no truth in the miraculous accounts of Christ&rsquo;s Death
and Resurrection, the whole of the religion founded upon the historic
truth of those events tumbled to the ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;My,&rdquo;
he exclaimed, with all the arrogance of youth, &ldquo;they put a gipsy
or fortune-teller into prison for getting money out of silly people
who think they have supernatural power; why should they not put a clergyman
in prison for pretending that he can absolve sins, or turn bread and
wine into the flesh and blood of One who died two thousand years ago?&nbsp;
What,&rdquo; he asked himself, &ldquo;could be more pure &lsquo;hanky-panky&rsquo;
than that a bishop should lay his hands upon a young man and pretend
to convey to him the spiritual power to work this miracle?&nbsp; It
was all very well to talk about toleration; toleration, like everything
else, had its limits; besides, if it was to include the bishop let it
include the fortune-teller too.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would explain all this
to the Archbishop of Canterbury by and by, but as he could not get hold
of him just now, it occurred to him that he might experimentalise advantageously
upon the viler soul of the prison chaplain.&nbsp; It was only those
who took the first and most obvious step in their power who ever did
great things in the end, so one day, when Mr Hughes&mdash;for this was
the chaplain&rsquo;s name&mdash;was talking with him, Ernest introduced
the question of Christian evidences, and tried to raise a discussion
upon them.&nbsp; Mr Hughes had been very kind to him, but he was more
than twice my hero&rsquo;s age, and had long taken the measure of such
objections as Ernest tried to put before him.&nbsp; I do not suppose
he believed in the actual objective truth of the stories about Christ&rsquo;s
Resurrection and Ascension any more than Ernest did, but he knew that
this was a small matter, and that the real issue lay much deeper than
this.</p>
<p>Mr Hughes was a man who had been in authority for many years, and
he brushed Ernest on one side as if he had been a fly.&nbsp; He did
it so well that my hero never ventured to tackle him again, and confined
his conversation with him for the future to such matters as what he
had better do when he got out of prison; and here Mr Hughes was ever
ready to listen to him with sympathy and kindness.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXVI</h2>
<p>Ernest was now so far convalescent as to be able to sit up for the
greater part of the day.&nbsp; He had been three months in prison, and,
though not strong enough to leave the infirmary, was beyond all fear
of a relapse.&nbsp; He was talking one day with Mr Hughes about his
future, and again expressed his intention of emigrating to Australia
or New Zealand with the money he should recover from Pryer.&nbsp; Whenever
he spoke of this he noticed that Mr Hughes looked grave and was silent:
he had thought that perhaps the chaplain wanted him to return to his
profession, and disapproved of his evident anxiety to turn to something
else; now, however, he asked Mr Hughes point blank why it was that he
disapproved of his idea of emigrating.</p>
<p>Mr Hughes endeavoured to evade him, but Ernest was not to be put
off.&nbsp; There was something in the chaplain&rsquo;s manner which
suggested that he knew more than Ernest did, but did not like to say
it.&nbsp; This alarmed him so much that he begged him not to keep him
in suspense; after a little hesitation Mr Hughes, thinking him now strong
enough to stand it, broke the news as gently as he could that the whole
of Ernest&rsquo;s money had disappeared.</p>
<p>The day after my return from Battersby I called on my solicitor,
and was told that he had written to Pryer, requiring him to refund the
monies for which he had given his I.O.U.&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Pryer replied
that he had given orders to his broker to close his operations, which
unfortunately had resulted so far in heavy loss, and that the balance
should be paid to my solicitor on the following settling day, then about
a week distant.&nbsp; When the time came, we heard nothing from Pryer,
and going to his lodgings found that he had left with his few effects
on the very day after he had heard from us, and had not been seen since.</p>
<p>I had heard from Ernest the name of the broker who had been employed,
and went at once to see him.&nbsp; He told me Pryer had closed all his
accounts for cash on the day that Ernest had been sentenced, and had
received &pound;2315, which was all that remained of Ernest&rsquo;s
original &pound;5000.&nbsp; With this he had decamped, nor had we enough
clue as to his whereabouts to be able to take any steps to recover the
money.&nbsp; There was in fact nothing to be done but to consider the
whole as lost.&nbsp; I may say here that neither I nor Ernest ever heard
of Pryer again, nor have any idea what became of him.</p>
<p>This placed me in a difficult position.&nbsp; I knew, of course,
that in a few years Ernest would have many times over as much money
as he had lost, but I knew also that he did not know this, and feared
that the supposed loss of all he had in the world might be more than
he could stand when coupled with his other misfortunes.</p>
<p>The prison authorities had found Theobald&rsquo;s address from a
letter in Ernest&rsquo;s pocket, and had communicated with him more
than once concerning his son&rsquo;s illness, but Theobald had not written
to me, and I supposed my godson to be in good health.&nbsp; He would
be just twenty-four years old when he left prison, and if I followed
out his aunt&rsquo;s instructions, would have to battle with fortune
for another four years as well as he could.&nbsp; The question before
me was whether it was right to let him run so much risk, or whether
I should not to some extent transgress my instructions&mdash;which there
was nothing to prevent my doing if I thought Miss Pontifex would have
wished it&mdash;and let him have the same sum that he would have recovered
from Pryer.</p>
<p>If my godson had been an older man, and more fixed in any definite
groove, this is what I should have done, but he was still very young,
and more than commonly unformed for his age.&nbsp; If, again, I had
known of his illness I should not have dared to lay any heavier burden
on his back than he had to bear already; but not being uneasy about
his health, I thought a few years of roughing it and of experience concerning
the importance of not playing tricks with money would do him no harm.&nbsp;
So I decided to keep a sharp eye upon him as soon as he came out of
prison, and to let him splash about in deep water as best he could till
I saw whether he was able to swim, or was about to sink.&nbsp; In the
first case I would let him go on swimming till he was nearly eight-and-twenty,
when I would prepare him gradually for the good fortune that awaited
him; in the second I would hurry up to the rescue.&nbsp; So I wrote
to say that Pryer had absconded, and that he could have &pound;100 from
his father when he came out of prison.&nbsp; I then waited to see what
effect these tidings would have, not expecting to receive an answer
for three months, for I had been told on enquiry that no letter could
be received by a prisoner till after he had been three months in gaol.&nbsp;
I also wrote to Theobald and told him of Pryer&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, when my letter arrived the governor of the gaol
read it, and in a case of such importance would have relaxed the rules
if Ernest&rsquo;s state had allowed it; his illness prevented this,
and the governor left it to the chaplain and the doctor to break the
news to him when they thought him strong enough to bear it, which was
now the case.&nbsp; In the meantime I received a formal official document
saying that my letter had been received and would be communicated to
the prisoner in due course; I believe it was simply through a mistake
on the part of a clerk that I was not informed of Ernest&rsquo;s illness,
but I heard nothing of it till I saw him by his own desire a few days
after the chaplin had broken to him the substance of what I had written.</p>
<p>Ernest was terribly shocked when he heard of the loss of his money,
but his ignorance of the world prevented him from seeing the full extent
of the mischief.&nbsp; He had never been in serious want of money yet,
and did not know what it meant.&nbsp; In reality, money losses are the
hardest to bear of any by those who are old enough to comprehend them.</p>
<p>A man can stand being told that he must submit to a severe surgical
operation, or that he has some disease which will shortly kill him,
or that he will be a cripple or blind for the rest of his life; dreadful
as such tidings must be, we do not find that they unnerve the greater
number of mankind; most men, indeed, go coolly enough even to be hanged,
but the strongest quail before financial ruin, and the better men they
are, the more complete, as a general rule, is their prostration.&nbsp;
Suicide is a common consequence of money losses; it is rarely sought
as a means of escape from bodily suffering.&nbsp; If we feel that we
have a competence at our backs, so that we can die warm and quietly
in our beds, with no need to worry about expense, we live our lives
out to the dregs, no matter how excruciating our torments.&nbsp; Job
probably felt the loss of his flocks and herds more than that of his
wife and family, for he could enjoy his flocks and herds without his
family, but not his family&mdash;not for long&mdash;if he had lost all
his money.&nbsp; Loss of money indeed is not only the worst pain in
itself, but it is the parent of all others.&nbsp; Let a man have been
brought up to a moderate competence, and have no specially; then let
his money be suddenly taken from him, and how long is his health likely
to survive the change in all his little ways which loss of money will
entail?&nbsp; How long again is the esteem and sympathy of friends likely
to survive ruin?&nbsp; People may be very sorry for us, but their attitude
towards us hitherto has been based upon the supposition that we were
situated thus or thus in money matters; when this breaks down there
must be a restatement of the social problem so far as we are concerned;
we have been obtaining esteem under false pretences.&nbsp; Granted,
then, that the three most serious losses which a man can suffer are
those affecting money, health and reputation.&nbsp; Loss of money is
far the worst, then comes ill-health, and then loss of reputation; loss
of reputation is a bad third, for, if a man keeps health and money unimpaired,
it will be generally found that his loss of reputation is due to breaches
of parvenu conventions only, and not to violations of those older, better
established canons whose authority is unquestionable.&nbsp; In this
case a man may grow a new reputation as easily as a lobster grows a
new claw, or, if he have health and money, may thrive in great peace
of mind without any reputation at all.&nbsp; The only chance for a man
who has lost his money is that he shall still be young enough to stand
uprooting and transplanting without more than temporary derangement,
and this I believed my godson still to be.</p>
<p>By the prison rules he might receive and send a letter after he had
been in gaol three months, and might also receive one visit from a friend.&nbsp;
When he received my letter, he at once asked me to come and see him,
which of course I did.&nbsp; I found him very much changed, and still
so feeble, that the exertion of coming from the infirmary to the cell
in which I was allowed to see him, and the agitation of seeing me were
too much for him.&nbsp; At first he quite broke down, and I was so pained
at the state in which I found him, that I was on the point of breaking
my instructions then and there.&nbsp; I contented myself, however, for
the time, with assuring him that I would help him as soon as he came
out of prison, and that, when he had made up his mind what he would
do, he was to come to me for what money might be necessary, if he could
not get it from his father.&nbsp; To make it easier for him I told him
that his aunt, on her death-bed, had desired me to do something of this
sort should an emergency arise, so that he would only be taking what
his aunt had left him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will not take the &pound;100
from my father, and I will never see him or my mother again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;Take the &pound;100, Ernest, and as much more as you
can get, and then do not see them again if you do not like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Ernest would not do.&nbsp; If he took money from them, he could
not cut them, and he wanted to cut them.&nbsp; I thought my godson would
get on a great deal better if he would only have the firmness to do
as he proposed, as regards breaking completely with his father and mother,
and said so.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t you like them?&rdquo; said
he, with a look of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like them!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re horrid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the kindest thing of all you have done for
me,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I thought all&mdash;all middle-aged
people liked my father and mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had been about to call me old, but I was only fifty-seven, and
was not going to have this, so I made a face when I saw him hesitating,
which drove him into &ldquo;middle-aged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you like it,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I will say all your
family are horrid except yourself and your aunt Alethea.&nbsp; The greater
part of every family is always odious; if there are one or two good
ones in a very large family, it is as much as can be expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he replied, gratefully, &ldquo;I think I
can now stand almost anything.&nbsp; I will come and see you as soon
as I come out of gaol.&nbsp; Good-bye.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the warder had
told us that the time allowed for our interview was at an end.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXVII</h2>
<p>As soon as Ernest found that he had no money to look to upon leaving
prison he saw that his dreams about emigrating and farming must come
to an end, for he knew that he was incapable of working at the plough
or with the axe for long together himself.&nbsp; And now it seemed he
should have no money to pay any one else for doing so.&nbsp; It was
this that resolved him to part once and for all with his parents.&nbsp;
If he had been going abroad he could have kept up relations with them,
for they would have been too far off to interfere with him.</p>
<p>He knew his father and mother would object to being cut; they would
wish to appear kind and forgiving; they would also dislike having no
further power to plague him; but he knew also very well that so long
as he and they ran in harness together they would be always pulling
one way and he another.&nbsp; He wanted to drop the gentleman and go
down into the ranks, beginning on the lowest rung of the ladder, where
no one would know of his disgrace or mind it if he did know; his father
and mother on the other hand would wish him to clutch on to the fag-end
of gentility at a starvation salary and with no prospect of advancement.&nbsp;
Ernest had seen enough in Ashpit Place to know that a tailor, if he
did not drink and attended to his business, could earn more money than
a clerk or a curate, while much less expense by way of show was required
of him.&nbsp; The tailor also had more liberty, and a better chance
of rising.&nbsp; Ernest resolved at once, as he had fallen so far, to
fall still lower&mdash;promptly, gracefully and with the idea of rising
again, rather than cling to the skirts of a respectability which would
permit him to exist on sufferance only, and make him pay an utterly
extortionate price for an article which he could do better without.</p>
<p>He arrived at this result more quickly than he might otherwise have
done through remembering something he had once heard his aunt say about
&ldquo;kissing the soil.&rdquo;&nbsp; This had impressed him and stuck
by him perhaps by reason of its brevity; when later on he came to know
the story of Hercules and Ant&aelig;us, he found it one of the very
few ancient fables which had a hold over him&mdash;his chiefest debt
to classical literature.&nbsp; His aunt had wanted him to learn carpentering,
as a means of kissing the soil should his Hercules ever throw him.&nbsp;
It was too late for this now&mdash;or he thought it was&mdash;but the
mode of carrying out his aunt&rsquo;s idea was a detail; there were
a hundred ways of kissing the soil besides becoming a carpenter.</p>
<p>He had told me this during our interview, and I had encouraged him
to the utmost of my power.&nbsp; He showed so much more good sense than
I had given him credit for that I became comparatively easy about him,
and determined to let him play his own game, being always, however,
ready to hand in case things went too far wrong.&nbsp; It was not simply
because he disliked his father and mother that he wanted to have no
more to do with them; if it had been only this he would have put up
with them; but a warning voice within told him distinctly enough that
if he was clean cut away from them he might still have a chance of success,
whereas if they had anything whatever to do with him, or even knew where
he was, they would hamper him and in the end ruin him.&nbsp; Absolute
independence he believed to be his only chance of very life itself.</p>
<p>Over and above this&mdash;if this were not enough&mdash;Ernest had
a faith in his own destiny such as most young men, I suppose, feel,
but the grounds of which were not apparent to any one but himself.&nbsp;
Rightly or wrongly, in a quiet way he believed he possessed a strength
which, if he were only free to use it in his own way, might do great
things some day.&nbsp; He did not know when, nor where, nor how his
opportunity was to come, but he never doubted that it would come in
spite of all that had happened, and above all else he cherished the
hope that he might know how to seize it if it came, for whatever it
was it would be something that no one else could do so well as he could.&nbsp;
People said there were no dragons and giants for adventurous men to
fight with nowadays; it was beginning to dawn upon him that there were
just as many now as at any past time.</p>
<p>Monstrous as such a faith may seem in one who was qualifying himself
for a high mission by a term of imprisonment, he could no more help
it than he could help breathing; it was innate in him, and it was even
more with a view to this than for other reasons that he wished to sever
the connection between himself and his parents; for he knew that if
ever the day came in which it should appear that before him too there
was a race set in which it might be an honour to have run among the
foremost, his father and mother would be the first to let him and hinder
him in running it.&nbsp; They had been the first to say that he ought
to run such a race; they would also be the first to trip him up if he
took them at their word, and then afterwards upbraid him for not having
won.&nbsp; Achievement of any kind would be impossible for him unless
he was free from those who would be for ever dragging him back into
the conventional.&nbsp; The conventional had been tried already and
had been found wanting.</p>
<p>He had an opportunity now, if he chose to take it, of escaping once
for all from those who at once tormented him and would hold him earthward
should a chance of soaring open before him.&nbsp; He should never have
had it but for his imprisonment; but for this the force of habit and
routine would have been too strong for him; he should hardly have had
it if he had not lost all his money; the gap would not have been so
wide but that he might have been inclined to throw a plank across it.&nbsp;
He rejoiced now, therefore, over his loss of money as well as over his
imprisonment, which had made it more easy for him to follow his truest
and most lasting interests.</p>
<p>At times he wavered, when he thought of how his mother, who in her
way, as he thought, had loved him, would weep and think sadly over him,
or how perhaps she might even fall ill and die, and how the blame would
rest with him.&nbsp; At these times his resolution was near breaking,
but when he found I applauded his design, the voice within, which bade
him see his father&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s faces no more, grew louder
and more persistent.&nbsp; If he could not cut himself adrift from those
who he knew would hamper him, when so small an effort was wanted, his
dream of a destiny was idle; what was the prospect of a hundred pounds
from his father in comparison with jeopardy to this?&nbsp; He still
felt deeply the pain his disgrace had inflicted upon his father and
mother, but he was getting stronger, and reflected that as he had run
his chance with them for parents, so they must run theirs with him for
a son.</p>
<p>He had nearly settled down to this conclusion when he received a
letter from his father which made his decision final.&nbsp; If the prison
rules had been interpreted strictly, he would not have been allowed
to have this letter for another three months, as he had already heard
from me, but the governor took a lenient view, and considered the letter
from me to be a business communication hardly coming under the category
of a letter from friends.&nbsp; Theobald&rsquo;s letter therefore was
given to his son.&nbsp; It ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My dear Ernest, My object in writing is not to
upbraid you with the disgrace and shame you have inflicted upon your
mother and myself, to say nothing of your brother Joey, and your sister.&nbsp;
Suffer of course we must, but we know to whom to look in our affliction,
and are filled with anxiety rather on your behalf than our own.&nbsp;
Your mother is wonderful.&nbsp; She is pretty well in health, and desires
me to send you her love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you considered your prospects on leaving prison?&nbsp;
I understand from Mr Overton that you have lost the legacy which your
grandfather left you, together with all the interest that accrued during
your minority, in the course of speculation upon the Stock Exchange!&nbsp;
If you have indeed been guilty of such appalling folly it is difficult
to see what you can turn your hand to, and I suppose you will try to
find a clerkship in an office.&nbsp; Your salary will doubtless be low
at first, but you have made your bed and must not complain if you have
to lie upon it.&nbsp; If you take pains to please your employers they
will not be backward in promoting you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I first heard from Mr Overton of the unspeakable calamity
which had befallen your mother and myself, I had resolved not to see
you again.&nbsp; I am unwilling, however, to have recourse to a measure
which would deprive you of your last connecting link with respectable
people.&nbsp; Your mother and I will see you as soon as you come out
of prison; not at Battersby&mdash;we do not wish you to come down here
at present&mdash;but somewhere else, probably in London.&nbsp; You need
not shrink from seeing us; we shall not reproach you.&nbsp; We will
then decide about your future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At present our impression is that you will find a fairer start
probably in Australia or New Zealand than here, and I am prepared to
find you &pound;75 or even if necessary so far as &pound;100 to pay
your passage money.&nbsp; Once in the colony you must be dependent upon
your own exertions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May Heaven prosper them and you, and restore you to us years
hence a respected member of society.&mdash;Your affectionate father,
T. PONTIFEX.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there was a postscript in Christina&rsquo;s writing.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My darling, darling boy, pray with me daily and
hourly that we may yet again become a happy, united, God-fearing family
as we were before this horrible pain fell upon us.&mdash;Your sorrowing
but ever loving mother, C. P.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter did not produce the effect on Ernest that it would have
done before his imprisonment began.&nbsp; His father and mother thought
they could take him up as they had left him off.&nbsp; They forgot the
rapidity with which development follows misfortune, if the sufferer
is young and of a sound temperament.&nbsp; Ernest made no reply to his
father&rsquo;s letter, but his desire for a total break developed into
something like a passion.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are orphanages,&rdquo;
he exclaimed to himself, &ldquo;for children who have lost their parents&mdash;oh!
why, why, why, are there no harbours of refuge for grown men who have
not yet lost them?&rdquo;&nbsp; And he brooded over the bliss of Melchisedek
who had been born an orphan, without father, without mother, and without
descent.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXVIII</h2>
<p>When I think over all that Ernest told me about his prison meditations,
and the conclusions he was drawn to, it occurs to me that in reality
he was wanting to do the very last thing which it would have entered
into his head to think of wanting.&nbsp; I mean that he was trying to
give up father and mother for Christ&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; He would have
said he was giving them up because he thought they hindered him in the
pursuit of his truest and most lasting happiness.&nbsp; Granted, but
what is this if it is not Christ?&nbsp; What is Christ if He is not
this?&nbsp; He who takes the highest and most self-respecting view of
his own welfare which it is in his power to conceive, and adheres to
it in spite of conventionality, is a Christian whether he knows it and
calls himself one, or whether he does not.&nbsp; A rose is not the less
a rose because it does not know its own name.</p>
<p>What if circumstances had made his duty more easy for him than it
would be to most men?&nbsp; That was his luck, as much as it is other
people&rsquo;s luck to have other duties made easy for them by accident
of birth.&nbsp; Surely if people are born rich or handsome they have
a right to their good fortune.&nbsp; Some I know, will say that one
man has no right to be born with a better constitution than another;
others again will say that luck is the only righteous object of human
veneration.&nbsp; Both, I daresay, can make out a very good case, but
whichever may be right surely Ernest had as much right to the good luck
of finding a duty made easier as he had had to the bad fortune of falling
into the scrape which had got him into prison.&nbsp; A man is not to
be sneered at for having a trump card in his hand; he is only to be
sneered at if he plays his trump card badly.</p>
<p>Indeed, I question whether it is ever much harder for anyone to give
up father and mother for Christ&rsquo;s sake than it was for Ernest.&nbsp;
The relations between the parties will have almost always been severely
strained before it comes to this.&nbsp; I doubt whether anyone was ever
yet required to give up those to whom he was tenderly attached for a
mere matter of conscience: he will have ceased to be tenderly attached
to them long before he is called upon to break with them; for differences
of opinion concerning any matter of vital importance spring from differences
of constitution, and these will already have led to so much other disagreement
that the &ldquo;giving up&rdquo; when it comes, is like giving up an
aching but very loose and hollow tooth.&nbsp; It is the loss of those
whom we are not required to give up for Christ&rsquo;s sake which is
really painful to us.&nbsp; Then there is a wrench in earnest.&nbsp;
Happily, no matter how light the task that is demanded from us, it is
enough if we do it; we reap our reward, much as though it were a Herculean
labour.</p>
<p>But to return, the conclusion Ernest came to was that he would be
a tailor.&nbsp; He talked the matter over with the chaplain, who told
him there was no reason why he should not be able to earn his six or
seven shillings a day by the time he came out of prison, if he chose
to learn the trade during the remainder of his term&mdash;not quite
three months; the doctor said he was strong enough for this, and that
it was about the only thing he was as yet fit for; so he left the infirmary
sooner than he would otherwise have done and entered the tailor&rsquo;s
shop, overjoyed at the thoughts of seeing his way again, and confident
of rising some day if he could only get a firm foothold to start from.</p>
<p>Everyone whom he had to do with saw that he did not belong to what
are called the criminal classes, and finding him eager to learn and
to save trouble always treated him kindly and almost respectfully.&nbsp;
He did not find the work irksome: it was far more pleasant than making
Latin and Greek verses at Roughborough; he felt that he would rather
be here in prison than at Roughborough again&mdash;yes, or even at Cambridge
itself.&nbsp; The only trouble he was ever in danger of getting into
was through exchanging words or looks with the more decent-looking of
his fellow-prisoners.&nbsp; This was forbidden, but he never missed
a chance of breaking the rules in this respect.</p>
<p>Any man of his ability who was at the same time anxious to learn
would of course make rapid progress, and before he left prison the warder
said he was as good a tailor with his three months&rsquo; apprenticeship
as many a man was with twelve.&nbsp; Ernest had never before been so
much praised by any of his teachers.&nbsp; Each day as he grew stronger
in health and more accustomed to his surroundings he saw some fresh
advantage in his position, an advantage which he had not aimed at, but
which had come almost in spite of himself, and he marvelled at his own
good fortune, which had ordered things so greatly better for him than
he could have ordered them for himself.</p>
<p>His having lived six months in Ashpit Place was a case in point.&nbsp;
Things were possible to him which to others like him would be impossible.&nbsp;
If such a man as Towneley were told he must live henceforth in a house
like those in Ashpit Place it would be more than he could stand.&nbsp;
Ernest could not have stood it himself if he had gone to live there
of compulsion through want of money.&nbsp; It was only because he had
felt himself able to run away at any minute that he had not wanted to
do so; now, however, that he had become familiar with life in Ashpit
Place he no longer minded it, and could live gladly in lower parts of
London than that so long as he could pay his way.&nbsp; It was from
no prudence or forethought that he had served this apprenticeship to
life among the poor.&nbsp; He had been trying in a feeble way to be
thorough in his work: he had not been thorough, the whole thing had
been a <i>fiasco</i>; but he had made a little puny effort in the direction
of being genuine, and behold, in his hour of need it had been returned
to him with a reward far richer than he had deserved.&nbsp; He could
not have faced becoming one of the very poor unless he had had such
a bridge to conduct him over to them as he had found unwittingly in
Ashpit Place.&nbsp; True, there had been drawbacks in the particular
house he had chosen, but he need not live in a house where there was
a Mr Holt and he should no longer be tied to the profession which he
so much hated; if there were neither screams nor scripture readings
he could be happy in a garret at three shillings a week, such as Miss
Maitland lived in.</p>
<p>As he thought further he remembered that all things work together
for good to them that love God; was it possible, he asked himself, that
he too, however imperfectly, had been trying to love him?&nbsp; He dared
not answer Yes, but he would try hard that it should be so.&nbsp; Then
there came into his mind that noble air of Handel&rsquo;s: &ldquo;Great
God, who yet but darkly known,&rdquo; and he felt it as he had never
felt it before.&nbsp; He had lost his faith in Christianity, but his
faith in something&mdash;he knew not what, but that there was a something
as yet but darkly known which made right right and wrong wrong&mdash;his
faith in this grew stronger and stronger daily.</p>
<p>Again there crossed his mind thoughts of the power which he felt
to be in him, and of how and where it was to find its vent.&nbsp; The
same instinct which had led him to live among the poor because it was
the nearest thing to him which he could lay hold of with any clearness
came to his assistance here too.&nbsp; He thought of the Australian
gold and how those who lived among it had never seen it though it abounded
all around them: &ldquo;There is gold everywhere,&rdquo; he exclaimed
inwardly, &ldquo;to those who look for it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Might not his
opportunity be close upon him if he looked carefully enough at his immediate
surroundings?&nbsp; What was his position?&nbsp; He had lost all.&nbsp;
Could he not turn his having lost all into an opportunity?&nbsp; Might
he not, if he too sought the strength of the Lord, find, like St Paul,
that it was perfected in weakness?</p>
<p>He had nothing more to lose; money, friends, character, all were
gone for a very long time if not for ever; but there was something else
also that had taken its flight along with these.&nbsp; I mean the fear
of that which man could do unto him.&nbsp; <i>Cantabil vacuus</i>.&nbsp;
Who could hurt him more than he had been hurt already?&nbsp; Let him
but be able to earn his bread, and he knew of nothing which he dared
not venture if it would make the world a happier place for those who
were young and loveable.&nbsp; Herein he found so much comfort that
he almost wished he had lost his reputation even more completely&mdash;for
he saw that it was like a man&rsquo;s life which may be found of them
that lose it and lost of them that would find it.&nbsp; He should not
have had the courage to give up all for Christ&rsquo;s sake, but now
Christ had mercifully taken all, and lo! it seemed as though all were
found.</p>
<p>As the days went slowly by he came to see that Christianity and the
denial of Christianity after all met as much as any other extremes do;
it was a fight about names&mdash;not about things; practically the Church
of Rome, the Church of England, and the freethinker have the same ideal
standard and meet in the gentleman; for he is the most perfect saint
who is the most perfect gentleman.&nbsp; Then he saw also that it matters
little what profession, whether of religion or irreligion, a man may
make, provided only he follows it out with charitable inconsistency,
and without insisting on it to the bitter end.&nbsp; It is in the uncompromisingness
with which dogma is held and not in the dogma or want of dogma that
the danger lies.&nbsp; This was the crowning point of the edifice; when
he had got here he no longer wished to molest even the Pope.&nbsp; The
Archbishop of Canterbury might have hopped about all round him and even
picked crumbs out of his hand without running risk of getting a sly
sprinkle of salt.&nbsp; That wary prelate himself might perhaps have
been of a different opinion, but the robins and thrushes that hop about
our lawns are not more needlessly distrustful of the hand that throws
them out crumbs of bread in winter, than the Archbishop would have been
of my hero.</p>
<p>Perhaps he was helped to arrive at the foregoing conclusion by an
event which almost thrust inconsistency upon him.&nbsp; A few days after
he had left the infirmary the chaplain came to his cell and told him
that the prisoner who played the organ in chapel had just finished his
sentence and was leaving the prison; he therefore offered the post to
Ernest, who he already knew played the organ.&nbsp; Ernest was at first
in doubt whether it would be right for him to assist at religious services
more than he was actually compelled to do, but the pleasure of playing
the organ, and the privileges which the post involved, made him see
excellent reasons for not riding consistency to death.&nbsp; Having,
then, once introduced an element of inconsistency into his system, he
was far too consistent not to be inconsistent consistently, and he lapsed
ere long into an amiable indifferentism which to outward appearance
differed but little from the indifferentism from which Mr Hawke had
aroused him.</p>
<p>By becoming organist he was saved from the treadmill, for which the
doctor had said he was unfit as yet, but which he would probably have
been put to in due course as soon as he was stronger.&nbsp; He might
have escaped the tailor&rsquo;s shop altogether and done only the comparatively
light work of attending to the chaplain&rsquo;s rooms if he had liked,
but he wanted to learn as much tailoring as he could, and did not therefore
take advantage of this offer; he was allowed, however, two hours a day
in the afternoon for practice.&nbsp; From that moment his prison life
ceased to be monotonous, and the remaining two months of his sentence
slipped by almost as rapidly as they would have done if he had been
free.&nbsp; What with music, books, learning his trade, and conversation
with the chaplain, who was just the kindly, sensible person that Ernest
wanted in order to steady him a little, the days went by so pleasantly
that when the time came for him to leave prison, he did so, or thought
he did so, not without regret.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXIX</h2>
<p>In coming to the conclusion that he would sever the connection between
himself and his family once for all Ernest had reckoned without his
family.&nbsp; Theobald wanted to be rid of his son, it is true, in so
far as he wished him to be no nearer at any rate than the Antipodes;
but he had no idea of entirely breaking with him.&nbsp; He knew his
son well enough to have a pretty shrewd idea that this was what Ernest
would wish himself, and perhaps as much for this reason as for any other
he was determined to keep up the connection, provided it did not involve
Ernest&rsquo;s coming to Battersby nor any recurring outlay.</p>
<p>When the time approached for him to leave prison, his father and
mother consulted as to what course they should adopt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must never leave him to himself,&rdquo; said Theobald impressively;
&ldquo;we can neither of us wish that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! no! dearest Theobald,&rdquo; exclaimed Christina.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whoever else deserts him, and however distant he may be from
us, he must still feel that he has parents whose hearts beat with affection
for him no matter how cruelly he has pained them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been his own worst enemy,&rdquo; said Theobald.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He has never loved us as we deserved, and now he will be withheld
by false shame from wishing to see us.&nbsp; He will avoid us if he
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must go to him ourselves,&rdquo; said Christina, &ldquo;whether
he likes it or not we must be at his side to support him as he enters
again upon the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we do not want him to give us the slip we must catch him
as he leaves prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will, we will; our faces shall be the first to gladden
his eyes as he comes out, and our voices the first to exhort him to
return to the paths of virtue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Theobald, &ldquo;if he sees us in the
street he will turn round and run away from us.&nbsp; He is intensely
selfish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must get leave to go inside the prison, and see him
before he gets outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a good deal of discussion this was the plan they decided on
adopting, and having so decided, Theobald wrote to the governor of the
gaol asking whether he could be admitted inside the gaol to receive
Ernest when his sentence had expired.&nbsp; He received answer in the
affirmative, and the pair left Battersby the day before Ernest was to
come out of prison.</p>
<p>Ernest had not reckoned on this, and was rather surprised on being
told a few minutes before nine that he was to go into the receiving
room before he left the prison as there were visitors waiting to see
him.&nbsp; His heart fell, for he guessed who they were, but he screwed
up his courage and hastened to the receiving room.&nbsp; There, sure
enough, standing at the end of the table nearest the door were the two
people whom he regarded as the most dangerous enemies he had in all
the world&mdash;his father and mother.</p>
<p>He could not fly, but he knew that if he wavered he was lost.</p>
<p>His mother was crying, but she sprang forward to meet him and clasped
him in her arms.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, my boy, my boy,&rdquo; she sobbed,
and she could say no more.</p>
<p>Ernest was as white as a sheet.&nbsp; His heart beat so that he could
hardly breathe.&nbsp; He let his mother embrace him, and then withdrawing
himself stood silently before her with the tears falling from his eyes.</p>
<p>At first he could not speak.&nbsp; For a minute or so the silence
on all sides was complete.&nbsp; Then, gathering strength, he said in
a low voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; (it was the first time he had called her anything
but &ldquo;mamma&rdquo;?) &ldquo;we must part.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this,
turning to the warder, he said: &ldquo;I believe I am free to leave
the prison if I wish to do so.&nbsp; You cannot compel me to remain
here longer.&nbsp; Please take me to the gates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Theobald stepped forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ernest, you must not, shall
not, leave us in this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not speak to me,&rdquo; said Ernest, his eyes flashing
with a fire that was unwonted in them.&nbsp; Another warder then came
up and took Theobald aside, while the first conducted Ernest to the
gates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them,&rdquo; said Ernest, &ldquo;from me that they must
think of me as one dead, for I am dead to them.&nbsp; Say that my greatest
pain is the thought of the disgrace I have inflicted upon them, and
that above all things else I will study to avoid paining them hereafter;
but say also that if they write to me I will return their letters unopened,
and that if they come and see me I will protect myself in whatever way
I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time he was at the prison gate, and in another moment was
at liberty.&nbsp; After he had got a few steps out he turned his face
to the prison wall, leant against it for support, and wept as though
his heart would break.</p>
<p>Giving up father and mother for Christ&rsquo;s sake was not such
an easy matter after all.&nbsp; If a man has been possessed by devils
for long enough they will rend him as they leave him, however imperatively
they may have been cast out.&nbsp; Ernest did not stay long where he
was, for he feared each moment that his father and mother would come
out.&nbsp; He pulled himself together and turned into the labyrinth
of small streets which opened out in front of him.</p>
<p>He had crossed his Rubicon&mdash;not perhaps very heroically or dramatically,
but then it is only in dramas that people act dramatically.&nbsp; At
any rate, by hook or by crook, he had scrambled over, and was out upon
the other side.&nbsp; Already he thought of much which he would gladly
have said, and blamed his want of presence of mind; but, after all,
it mattered very little.&nbsp; Inclined though he was to make very great
allowances for his father and mother, he was indignant at their having
thrust themselves upon him without warning at a moment when the excitement
of leaving prison was already as much as he was fit for.&nbsp; It was
a mean advantage to have taken over him, but he was glad they had taken
it, for it made him realise more fully than ever that his one chance
lay in separating himself completely from them.</p>
<p>The morning was grey, and the first signs of winter fog were beginning
to show themselves, for it was now the 30th of September.&nbsp; Ernest
wore the clothes in which he had entered prison, and was therefore dressed
as a clergyman.&nbsp; No one who looked at him would have seen any difference
between his present appearance and his appearance six months previously;
indeed, as he walked slowly through the dingy crowded lane called Eyre
Street Hill (which he well knew, for he had clerical friends in that
neighbourhood), the months he had passed in prison seemed to drop out
of his life, and so powerfully did association carry him away that,
finding himself in his old dress and in his old surroundings, he felt
dragged back into his old self&mdash;as though his six months of prison
life had been a dream from which he was now waking to take things up
as he had left them.&nbsp; This was the effect of unchanged surroundings
upon the unchanged part of him.&nbsp; But there was a changed part,
and the effect of unchanged surroundings upon this was to make everything
seem almost as strange as though he had never had any life but his prison
one, and was now born into a new world.</p>
<p>All our lives long, every day and every hour, we are engaged in the
process of accommodating our changed and unchanged selves to changed
and unchanged surroundings; living, in fact, in nothing else than this
process of accommodation; when we fail in it a little we are stupid,
when we fail flagrantly we are mad, when we suspend it temporarily we
sleep, when we give up the attempt altogether we die.&nbsp; In quiet,
uneventful lives the changes internal and external are so small that
there is little or no strain in the process of fusion and accommodation;
in other lives there is great strain, but there is also great fusing
and accommodating power; in others great strain with little accommodating
power.&nbsp; A life will be successful or not according as the power
of accommodation is equal to or unequal to the strain of fusing and
adjusting internal and external changes.</p>
<p>The trouble is that in the end we shall be driven to admit the unity
of the universe so completely as to be compelled to deny that there
is either an external or an internal, but must see everything both as
external and internal at one and the same time, subject and object&mdash;external
and internal&mdash;being unified as much as everything else.&nbsp; This
will knock our whole system over, but then every system has got to be
knocked over by something.</p>
<p>Much the best way out of this difficulty is to go in for separation
between internal and external&mdash;subject and object&mdash;when we
find this convenient, and unity between the same when we find unity
convenient.&nbsp; This is illogical, but extremes are alone logical,
and they are always absurd, the mean is alone practicable and it is
always illogical.&nbsp; It is faith and not logic which is the supreme
arbiter.&nbsp; They say all roads lead to Rome, and all philosophies
that I have ever seen lead ultimately either to some gross absurdity,
or else to the conclusion already more than once insisted on in these
pages, that the just shall live by faith, that is to say that sensible
people will get through life by rule of thumb as they may interpret
it most conveniently without asking too many questions for conscience
sake.&nbsp; Take any fact, and reason upon it to the bitter end, and
it will ere long lead to this as the only refuge from some palpable
folly.</p>
<p>But to return to my story.&nbsp; When Ernest got to the top of the
street and looked back, he saw the grimy, sullen walls of his prison
filling up the end of it.&nbsp; He paused for a minute or two.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;I was hemmed in by bolts
which I could see and touch; here I am barred by others which are none
the less real&mdash;poverty and ignorance of the world.&nbsp; It was
no part of my business to try to break the material bolts of iron and
escape from prison, but now that I am free I must surely seek to break
these others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had read somewhere of a prisoner who had made his escape by cutting
up his bedstead with an iron spoon.&nbsp; He admired and marvelled at
the man&rsquo;s mind, but could not even try to imitate him; in the
presence of immaterial barriers, however, he was not so easily daunted,
and felt as though, even if the bed were iron and the spoon a wooden
one, he could find some means of making the wood cut the iron sooner
or later.</p>
<p>He turned his back upon Eyre Street Hill and walked down Leather
Lane into Holborn.&nbsp; Each step he took, each face or object that
he knew, helped at once to link him on to the life he had led before
his imprisonment, and at the same time to make him feel how completely
that imprisonment had cut his life into two parts, the one of which
could bear no resemblance to the other.</p>
<p>He passed down Fetter Lane into Fleet Street and so to the Temple,
to which I had just returned from my summer holiday.&nbsp; It was about
half past nine, and I was having my breakfast, when I heard a timid
knock at the door and opened it to find Ernest.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXX</h2>
<p>I had begun to like him on the night Towneley had sent for me, and
on the following day I thought he had shaped well.&nbsp; I had liked
him also during our interview in prison, and wanted to see more of him,
so that I might make up my mind about him.&nbsp; I had lived long enough
to know that some men who do great things in the end are not very wise
when they are young; knowing that he would leave prison on the 30th,
I had expected him, and, as I had a spare bedroom, pressed him to stay
with me, till he could make up his mind what he would do.</p>
<p>Being so much older than he was, I anticipated no trouble in getting
my own way, but he would not hear of it.&nbsp; The utmost he would assent
to was that he should be my guest till he could find a room for himself,
which he would set about doing at once.</p>
<p>He was still much agitated, but grew better as he ate a breakfast,
not of prison fare and in a comfortable room.&nbsp; It pleased me to
see the delight he took in all about him; the fireplace with a fire
in it; the easy chairs, the <i>Times</i>, my cat, the red geraniums
in the window, to say nothing of coffee, bread and butter, sausages,
marmalade, etc.&nbsp; Everything was pregnant with the most exquisite
pleasure to him.&nbsp; The plane trees were full of leaf still; he kept
rising from the breakfast table to admire them; never till now, he said,
had he known what the enjoyment of these things really was.&nbsp; He
ate, looked, laughed and cried by turns, with an emotion which I can
neither forget nor describe.</p>
<p>He told me how his father and mother had lain in wait for him, as
he was about to leave prison.&nbsp; I was furious, and applauded him
heartily for what he had done.&nbsp; He was very grateful to me for
this.&nbsp; Other people, he said, would tell him he ought to think
of his father and mother rather than of himself, and it was such a comfort
to find someone who saw things as he saw them himself.&nbsp; Even if
I had differed from him I should not have said so, but I was of his
opinion, and was almost as much obliged to him for seeing things as
I saw them, as he to me for doing the same kind office by himself.&nbsp;
Cordially as I disliked Theobald and Christina, I was in such a hopeless
minority in the opinion I had formed concerning them that it was pleasant
to find someone who agreed with me.</p>
<p>Then there came an awful moment for both of us.</p>
<p>A knock, as of a visitor and not a postman, was heard at my door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness gracious,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t
we sport the oak?&nbsp; Perhaps it is your father.&nbsp; But surely
he would hardly come at this time of day!&nbsp; Go at once into my bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went to the door, and, sure enough, there were both Theobald and
Christina.&nbsp; I could not refuse to let them in and was obliged to
listen to their version of the story, which agreed substantially with
Ernest&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Christina cried bitterly&mdash;Theobald stormed.&nbsp;
After about ten minutes, during which I assured them that I had not
the faintest conception where their son was, I dismissed them both.&nbsp;
I saw they looked suspiciously upon the manifest signs that someone
was breakfasting with me, and parted from me more or less defiantly,
but I got rid of them, and poor Ernest came out again, looking white,
frightened and upset.&nbsp; He had heard voices, but no more, and did
not feel sure that the enemy might not be gaining over me.&nbsp; We
sported the oak now, and before long he began to recover.</p>
<p>After breakfast, we discussed the situation.&nbsp; I had taken away
his wardrobe and books from Mrs Jupp&rsquo;s, but had left his furniture,
pictures and piano, giving Mrs Jupp the use of these, so that she might
let her room furnished, in lieu of charge for taking care of the furniture.&nbsp;
As soon as Ernest heard that his wardrobe was at hand, he got out a
suit of clothes he had had before he had been ordained, and put it on
at once, much, as I thought, to the improvement of his personal appearance.</p>
<p>Then we went into the subject of his finances.&nbsp; He had had ten
pounds from Pryer only a day or two before he was apprehended, of which
between seven and eight were in his purse when he entered the prison.&nbsp;
This money was restored to him on leaving.&nbsp; He had always paid
cash for whatever he bought, so that there was nothing to be deducted
for debts.&nbsp; Besides this, he had his clothes, books and furniture.&nbsp;
He could, as I have said, have had &pound;100 from his father if he
had chosen to emigrate, but this both Ernest and I (for he brought me
round to his opinion) agreed it would be better to decline.&nbsp; This
was all he knew of as belonging to him.</p>
<p>He said he proposed at once taking an unfurnished top back attic
in as quiet a house as he could find, say at three or four shillings
a week, and looking out for work as a tailor.&nbsp; I did not think
it much mattered what he began with, for I felt pretty sure he would
ere long find his way to something that suited him, if he could get
a start with anything at all.&nbsp; The difficulty was how to get him
started.&nbsp; It was not enough that he should be able to cut out and
make clothes&mdash;that he should have the organs, so to speak, of a
tailor; he must be put into a tailor&rsquo;s shop and guided for a little
while by someone who knew how and where to help him.</p>
<p>The rest of the day he spent in looking for a room, which he soon
found, and in familiarising himself with liberty.&nbsp; In the evening
I took him to the Olympic, where Robson was then acting in a burlesque
on Macbeth, Mrs Keeley, if I remember rightly, taking the part of Lady
Macbeth.&nbsp; In the scene before the murder, Macbeth had said he could
not kill Duncan when he saw his boots upon the landing.&nbsp; Lady Macbeth
put a stop to her husband&rsquo;s hesitation by whipping him up under
her arm, and carrying him off the stage, kicking and screaming.&nbsp;
Ernest laughed till he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;What rot Shakespeare is after
this,&rdquo; he exclaimed, involuntarily.&nbsp; I remembered his essay
on the Greek tragedians, and was more I <i>&eacute;pris</i> with him
than ever.</p>
<p>Next day he set about looking for employment, and I did not see him
till about five o&rsquo;clock, when he came and said that he had had
no success.&nbsp; The same thing happened the next day and the day after
that.&nbsp; Wherever he went he was invariably refused and often ordered
point blank out of the shop; I could see by the expression of his face,
though he said nothing, that he was getting frightened, and began to
think I should have to come to the rescue.&nbsp; He said he had made
a great many enquiries and had always been told the same story.&nbsp;
He found that it was easy to keep on in an old line, but very hard to
strike out into a new one.</p>
<p>He talked to the fishmonger in Leather Lane, where he went to buy
a bloater for his tea, casually as though from curiosity and without
any interested motive.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sell,&rdquo; said the master of
the shop, &ldquo;Why nobody wouldn&rsquo;t believe what can be sold
by penn&rsquo;orths and twopenn&rsquo;orths if you go the right way
to work.&nbsp; Look at whelks, for instance.&nbsp; Last Saturday night
me and my little Emma here, we sold &pound;7 worth of whelks between
eight and half past eleven o&rsquo;clock&mdash;and almost all in penn&rsquo;orths
and twopenn&rsquo;orths&mdash;a few, hap&rsquo;orths, but not many.&nbsp;
It was the steam that did it.&nbsp; We kept a-boiling of &rsquo;em hot
and hot, and whenever the steam came strong up from the cellar on to
the pavement, the people bought, but whenever the steam went down they
left off buying; so we boiled them over and over again till they was
all sold.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s just where it is; if you know your business
you can sell, if you don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;ll soon make a mess of it.&nbsp;
Why, but for the steam, I should not have sold 10s. worth of whelks
all the night through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, and many another yarn of kindred substance which he heard from
other people determined Ernest more than ever to stake on tailoring
as the one trade about which he knew anything at all, nevertheless,
here were three or four days gone by and employment seemed as far off
as ever.</p>
<p>I now did what I ought to have done before, that is to say, I called
on my own tailor whom I had dealt with for over a quarter of a century
and asked his advice.&nbsp; He declared Ernest&rsquo;s plan to be hopeless.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If,&rdquo; said Mr Larkins, for this was my tailor&rsquo;s name,
&ldquo;he had begun at fourteen, it might have done, but no man of twenty-four
could stand being turned to work into a workshop full of tailors; he
would not get on with the men, nor the men with him; you could not expect
him to be &lsquo;hail fellow, well met&rsquo; with them, and you could
not expect his fellow-workmen to like him if he was not.&nbsp; A man
must have sunk low through drink or natural taste for low company, before
he could get on with those who have had such a different training from
his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Larkins said a great deal more and wound up by taking me to see
the place where his own men worked.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is a paradise,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;compared to most workshops.&nbsp; What gentleman could
stand this air, think you, for a fortnight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was glad enough to get out of the hot, fetid atmosphere in five
minutes, and saw that there was no brick of Ernest&rsquo;s prison to
be loosened by going and working among tailors in a workshop.</p>
<p>Mr Larkins wound up by saying that even if my <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>
were a much better workman than he probably was, no master would give
him employment, for fear of creating a bother among the men.</p>
<p>I left, feeling that I ought to have thought of all this myself,
and was more than ever perplexed as to whether I had not better let
my young friend have a few thousand pounds and send him out to the colonies,
when, on my return home at about five o&rsquo;clock, I found him waiting
for me, radiant, and declaring that he had found all he wanted.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXI</h2>
<p>It seems he had been patrolling the streets for the last three or
four nights&mdash;I suppose in search of something to do&mdash;at any
rate knowing better what he wanted to get than how to get it.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, what he wanted was in reality so easily to be found that
it took a highly educated scholar like himself to be unable to find
it.&nbsp; But, however this may be, he had been scared, and now saw
lions where there were none, and was shocked and frightened, and night
after night his courage had failed him and he had returned to his lodgings
in Laystall Street without accomplishing his errand.&nbsp; He had not
taken me into his confidence upon this matter, and I had not enquired
what he did with himself in the evenings.&nbsp; At last he had concluded
that, however painful it might be to him, he would call on Mrs Jupp,
who he thought would be able to help him if anyone could.&nbsp; He had
been walking moodily from seven till about nine, and now resolved to
go straight to Ashpit Place and make a mother confessor of Mrs Jupp
without more delay.</p>
<p>Of all tasks that could be performed by mortal woman there was none
which Mrs Jupp would have liked better than the one Ernest was thinking
of imposing upon her; nor do I know that in his scared and broken-down
state he could have done much better than he now proposed.&nbsp; Miss
Jupp would have made it very easy for him to open his grief to her;
indeed, she would have coaxed it all out of him before he knew where
he was; but the fates were against Mrs Jupp, and the meeting between
my hero and his former landlady was postponed <i>sine die</i>, for his
determination had hardly been formed and he had not gone more than a
hundred yards in the direction of Mrs Jupp&rsquo;s house, when a woman
accosted him.</p>
<p>He was turning from her, as he had turned from so many others, when
she started back with a movement that aroused his curiosity.&nbsp; He
had hardly seen her face, but being determined to catch sight of it,
followed her as she hurried away, and passed her; then turning round
he saw that she was none other than Ellen, the housemaid who had been
dismissed by his mother eight years previously.</p>
<p>He ought to have assigned Ellen&rsquo;s unwillingness to see him
to its true cause, but a guilty conscience made him think she had heard
of his disgrace and was turning away from him in contempt.&nbsp; Brave
as had been his resolutions about facing the world, this was more than
he was prepared for; &ldquo;What! you too shun me, Ellen?&rdquo; he
exclaimed.</p>
<p>The girl was crying bitterly and did not understand him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
Master Ernest,&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;let me go; you are too good
for the likes of me to speak to now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Ellen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what nonsense you talk;
you haven&rsquo;t been in prison, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no, no, not so bad as that,&rdquo; she exclaimed passionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have,&rdquo; said Ernest, with a forced laugh, &ldquo;I
came out three or four days ago after six months with hard labour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen did not believe him, but she looked at him with a &ldquo;Lor&rsquo;!
Master Ernest,&rdquo; and dried her eyes at once.&nbsp; The ice was
broken between them, for as a matter of fact Ellen had been in prison
several times, and though she did not believe Ernest, his merely saying
he had been in prison made her feel more at ease with him.&nbsp; For
her there were two classes of people, those who had been in prison and
those who had not.&nbsp; The first she looked upon as fellow-creatures
and more or less Christians, the second, with few exceptions, she regarded
with suspicion, not wholly unmingled with contempt.</p>
<p>Then Ernest told her what had happened to him during the last six
months, and by-and-by she believed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Ernest,&rdquo; said she, after they had talked for
a quarter of an hour or so, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a place over the way
where they sell tripe and onions.&nbsp; I know you was always very fond
of tripe and onions, let&rsquo;s go over and have some, and we can talk
better there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the pair crossed the street and entered the tripe shop; Ernest
ordered supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how is your pore dear mamma, and your dear papa, Master
Ernest,&rdquo; said Ellen, who had now recovered herself and was quite
at home with my hero.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, dear, dear me,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;I did love your pa; he was a good gentleman, he was, and your
ma too; it would do anyone good to live with her, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest was surprised and hardly knew what to say.&nbsp; He had expected
to find Ellen indignant at the way she had been treated, and inclined
to lay the blame of her having fallen to her present state at his father&rsquo;s
and mother&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; It was not so.&nbsp; Her only recollection
of Battersby was as of a place where she had had plenty to eat and drink,
not too much hard work, and where she had not been scolded.&nbsp; When
she heard that Ernest had quarrelled with his father and mother she
assumed as a matter of course that the fault must lie entirely with
Ernest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, your pore, pore ma!&rdquo; said Ellen.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
was always so very fond of you, Master Ernest: you was always her favourite;
I can&rsquo;t abear to think of anything between you and her.&nbsp;
To think now of the way she used to have me into the dining-room and
teach me my catechism, that she did!&nbsp; Oh, Master Ernest, you really
must go and make it all up with her; indeed you must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest felt rueful, but he had resisted so valiantly already that
the devil might have saved himself the trouble of trying to get at him
through Ellen in the matter of his father and mother.&nbsp; He changed
the subject, and the pair warmed to one another as they had their tripe
and pots of beer.&nbsp; Of all people in the world Ellen was perhaps
the one to whom Ernest could have spoken most freely at this juncture.&nbsp;
He told her what he thought he could have told to no one else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Ellen,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;I had learnt
as a boy things that I ought not to have learnt, and had never had a
chance of that which would have set me straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlefolks is always like that,&rdquo; said Ellen musingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you are right, but I am no longer a gentleman, Ellen,
and I don&rsquo;t see why I should be &lsquo;like that&rsquo; any longer,
my dear.&nbsp; I want you to help me to be like something else as soon
as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;! Master Ernest, whatever can you be meaning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pair soon afterwards left the eating-house and walked up Fetter
Lane together.</p>
<p>Ellen had had hard times since she had left Battersby, but they had
left little trace upon her.</p>
<p>Ernest saw only the fresh-looking smiling face, the dimpled cheek,
the clear blue eyes and lovely sphinx-like lips which he had remembered
as a boy.&nbsp; At nineteen she had looked older than she was, now she
looked much younger; indeed she looked hardly older than when Ernest
had last seen her, and it would have taken a man of much greater experience
than he possessed to suspect how completely she had fallen from her
first estate.&nbsp; It never occurred to him that the poor condition
of her wardrobe was due to her passion for ardent spirits, and that
first and last she had served five or six times as much time in gaol
as he had.&nbsp; He ascribed the poverty of her attire to the attempts
to keep herself respectable, which Ellen during supper had more than
once alluded to.&nbsp; He had been charmed with the way in which she
had declared that a pint of beer would make her tipsy, and had only
allowed herself to be forced into drinking the whole after a good deal
of remonstrance.&nbsp; To him she appeared a very angel dropped from
the sky, and all the more easy to get on with for being a fallen one.</p>
<p>As he walked up Fetter Lane with her towards Laystall Street, he
thought of the wonderful goodness of God towards him in throwing in
his way the very person of all others whom he was most glad to see,
and whom, of all others, in spite of her living so near him, he might
have never fallen in with but for a happy accident.</p>
<p>When people get it into their heads that they are being specially
favoured by the Almighty, they had better as a general rule mind their
p&rsquo;s and q&rsquo;s, and when they think they see the devil&rsquo;s
drift with more special clearness, let them remember that he has had
much more experience than they have, and is probably meditating mischief.</p>
<p>Already during supper the thought that in Ellen at last he had found
a woman whom he could love well enough to wish to live with and marry
had flitted across his mind, and the more they had chatted the more
reasons kept suggesting themselves for thinking that what might be folly
in ordinary cases would not be folly in his.</p>
<p>He must marry someone; that was already settled.&nbsp; He could not
marry a lady; that was absurd.&nbsp; He must marry a poor woman.&nbsp;
Yes, but a fallen one?&nbsp; Was he not fallen himself?&nbsp; Ellen
would fall no more.&nbsp; He had only to look at her to be sure of this.&nbsp;
He could not live with her in sin, not for more than the shortest time
that could elapse before their marriage; he no longer believed in the
supernatural element of Christianity, but the Christian morality at
any rate was indisputable.&nbsp; Besides, they might have children,
and a stigma would rest upon them.&nbsp; Whom had he to consult but
himself now?&nbsp; His father and mother never need know, and even if
they did, they should be thankful to see him married to any woman who
would make him happy as Ellen would.&nbsp; As for not being able to
afford marriage, how did poor people do?&nbsp; Did not a good wife rather
help matters than not?&nbsp; Where one could live two could do so, and
if Ellen was three or four years older than he was&mdash;well, what
was that?</p>
<p>Have you, gentle reader, ever loved at first sight?&nbsp; When you
fell in love at first sight, how long, let me ask, did it take you to
become ready to fling every other consideration to the winds except
that of obtaining possession of the loved one?&nbsp; Or rather, how
long would it have taken you if you had had no father or mother, nothing
to lose in the way of money, position, friends, professional advancement,
or what not, and if the object of your affections was as free from all
these <i>impedimenta</i> as you were yourself?</p>
<p>If you were a young John Stuart Mill, perhaps it would have taken
you some time, but suppose your nature was Quixotic, impulsive, altruistic,
guileless; suppose you were a hungry man starving for something to love
and lean upon, for one whose burdens you might bear, and who might help
you to bear yours.&nbsp; Suppose you were down on your luck, still stunned
by a horrible shock, and this bright vista of a happy future floated
suddenly before you, how long under these circumstances do you think
you would reflect before you would decide on embracing what chance had
thrown in your way?</p>
<p>It did not take my hero long, for before he got past the ham and
beef shop near the top of Fetter Lane, he had told Ellen that she must
come home with him and live with him till they could get married, which
they would do upon the first day that the law allowed.</p>
<p>I think the devil must have chuckled and made tolerably sure of his
game this time.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXII</h2>
<p>Ernest told Ellen of his difficulty about finding employment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do you think of going into a shop for, my dear,&rdquo;
said Ellen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why not take a little shop yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest asked how much this would cost.&nbsp; Ellen told him that
he might take a house in some small street, say near the &ldquo;Elephant
and Castle,&rdquo; for 17s. or 18s. a week, and let off the two top
floors for 10s., keeping the back parlour and shop for themselves.&nbsp;
If he could raise five or six pounds to buy some second-hand clothes
to stock the shop with, they could mend them and clean them, and she
could look after the women&rsquo;s clothes while he did the men&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Then he could mend and make, if he could get the orders.</p>
<p>They could soon make a business of &pound;2 a week in this way; she
had a friend who began like that and had now moved to a better shop,
where she made &pound;5 or &pound;6 a week at least&mdash;and she, Ellen,
had done the greater part of the buying and selling herself.</p>
<p>Here was a new light indeed.&nbsp; It was as though he had got his
&pound;5000 back again all of a sudden, and perhaps ever so much more
later on into the bargain.&nbsp; Ellen seemed more than ever to be his
good genius.</p>
<p>She went out and got a few rashers of bacon for his and her breakfast.&nbsp;
She cooked them much more nicely than he had been able to do, and laid
breakfast for him and made coffee, and some nice brown toast.&nbsp;
Ernest had been his own cook and housemaid for the last few days and
had not given himself satisfaction.&nbsp; Here he suddenly found himself
with someone to wait on him again.&nbsp; Not only had Ellen pointed
out to him how he could earn a living when no one except himself had
known how to advise him, but here she was so pretty and smiling, looking
after even his comforts, and restoring him practically in all respects
that he much cared about to the position which he had lost&mdash;or
rather putting him in one that he already liked much better.&nbsp; No
wonder he was radiant when he came to explain his plans to me.</p>
<p>He had some difficulty in telling all that had happened.&nbsp; He
hesitated, blushed, hummed and hawed.&nbsp; Misgivings began to cross
his mind when he found himself obliged to tell his story to someone
else.&nbsp; He felt inclined to slur things over, but I wanted to get
at the facts, so I helped him over the bad places, and questioned him
till I had got out pretty nearly the whole story as I have given it
above.</p>
<p>I hope I did not show it, but I was very angry.&nbsp; I had begun
to like Ernest.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why, but I never have heard
that any young man to whom I had become attached was going to get married
without hating his intended instinctively, though I had never seen her;
I have observed that most bachelors feel the same thing, though we are
generally at some pains to hide the fact.&nbsp; Perhaps it is because
we know we ought to have got married ourselves.&nbsp; Ordinarily we
say we are delighted&mdash;in the present case I did not feel obliged
to do this, though I made an effort to conceal my vexation.&nbsp; That
a young man of much promise who was heir also to what was now a handsome
fortune, should fling himself away upon such a person as Ellen was quite
too provoking, and the more so because of the unexpectedness of the
whole affair.</p>
<p>I begged him not to marry Ellen yet&mdash;not at least until he had
known her for a longer time.&nbsp; He would not hear of it; he had given
his word, and if he had not given it he should go and give it at once.&nbsp;
I had hitherto found him upon most matters singularly docile and easy
to manage, but on this point I could do nothing with him.&nbsp; His
recent victory over his father and mother had increased his strength,
and I was nowhere.&nbsp; I would have told him of his true position,
but I knew very well that this would only make him more bent on having
his own way&mdash;for with so much money why should he not please himself?&nbsp;
I said nothing, therefore, on this head, and yet all that I could urge
went for very little with one who believed himself to be an artisan
or nothing.</p>
<p>Really from his own standpoint there was nothing very outrageous
in what he was doing.&nbsp; He had known and been very fond of Ellen
years before.&nbsp; He knew her to come of respectable people, and to
have borne a good character, and to have been universally liked at Battersby.&nbsp;
She was then a quick, smart, hard-working girl&mdash;and a very pretty
one.&nbsp; When at last they met again she was on her best behaviour,
in fact, she was modesty and demureness itself.&nbsp; What wonder, then,
that his imagination should fail to realise the changes that eight years
must have worked?&nbsp; He knew too much against himself, and was too
bankrupt in love to be squeamish; if Ellen had been only what he thought
her, and if his prospects had been in reality no better than he believed
they were, I do not know that there is anything much more imprudent
in what Ernest proposed than there is in half the marriages that take
place every day.</p>
<p>There was nothing for it, however, but to make the best of the inevitable,
so I wished my young friend good fortune, and told him he could have
whatever money he wanted to start his shop with, if what he had in hand
was not sufficient.&nbsp; He thanked me, asked me to be kind enough
to let him do all my mending and repairing, and to get him any other
like orders that I could, and left me to my own reflections.</p>
<p>I was even more angry when he was gone than I had been while he was
with me.&nbsp; His frank, boyish face had beamed with a happiness that
had rarely visited it.&nbsp; Except at Cambridge he had hardly known
what happiness meant, and even there his life had been clouded as of
a man for whom wisdom at the greatest of its entrances was quite shut
out.&nbsp; I had seen enough of the world and of him to have observed
this, but it was impossible, or I thought it had been impossible, for
me to have helped him.</p>
<p>Whether I ought to have tried to help him or not I do not know, but
I am sure that the young of all animals often do want help upon matters
about which anyone would say <i>a priori</i> that there should be no
difficulty.&nbsp; One would think that a young seal would want no teaching
how to swim, nor yet a bird to fly, but in practice a young seal drowns
if put out of its depth before its parents have taught it to swim; and
so again, even the young hawk must be taught to fly before it can do
so.</p>
<p>I grant that the tendency of the times is to exaggerate the good
which teaching can do, but in trying to teach too much, in most matters,
we have neglected others in respect of which a little sensible teaching
would do no harm.</p>
<p>I know it is the fashion to say that young people must find out things
for themselves, and so they probably would if they had fair play to
the extent of not having obstacles put in their way.&nbsp; But they
seldom have fair play; as a general rule they meet with foul play, and
foul play from those who live by selling them stones made into a great
variety of shapes and sizes so as to form a tolerable imitation of bread.</p>
<p>Some are lucky enough to meet with few obstacles, some are plucky
enough to over-ride them, but in the greater number of cases, if people
are saved at all they are saved so as by fire.</p>
<p>While Ernest was with me Ellen was looking out for a shop on the
south side of the Thames near the &ldquo;Elephant and Castle,&rdquo;
which was then almost a new and a very rising neighbourhood.&nbsp; By
one o&rsquo;clock she had found several from which a selection was to
be made, and before night the pair had made their choice.</p>
<p>Ernest brought Ellen to me.&nbsp; I did not want to see her, but
could not well refuse.&nbsp; He had laid out a few of his shillings
upon her wardrobe, so that she was neatly dressed, and, indeed, she
looked very pretty and so good that I could hardly be surprised at Ernest&rsquo;s
infatuation when the other circumstances of the case were taken into
consideration.&nbsp; Of course we hated one another instinctively from
the first moment we set eyes on one another, but we each told Ernest
that we had been most favourably impressed.</p>
<p>Then I was taken to see the shop.&nbsp; An empty house is like a
stray dog or a body from which life has departed.&nbsp; Decay sets in
at once in every part of it, and what mould and wind and weather would
spare, street boys commonly destroy.&nbsp; Ernest&rsquo;s shop in its
untenanted state was a dirty unsavoury place enough.&nbsp; The house
was not old, but it had been run up by a jerry-builder and its constitution
had no stamina whatever.&nbsp; It was only by being kept warm and quiet
that it would remain in health for many months together.&nbsp; Now it
had been empty for some weeks and the cats had got in by night, while
the boys had broken the windows by day.&nbsp; The parlour floor was
covered with stones and dirt, and in the area was a dead dog which had
been killed in the street and been thrown down into the first unprotected
place that could be found.&nbsp; There was a strong smell throughout
the house, but whether it was bugs, or rats, or cats, or drains, or
a compound of all four, I could not determine.&nbsp; The sashes did
not fit, the flimsy doors hung badly; the skirting was gone in several
places, and there were not a few holes in the floor; the locks were
loose, and paper was torn and dirty; the stairs were weak and one felt
the treads give as one went up them.</p>
<p>Over and above these drawbacks the house had an ill name, by reason
of the fact that the wife of the last occupant had hanged herself in
it not very many weeks previously.&nbsp; She had set down a bloater
before the fire for her husband&rsquo;s tea, and had made him a round
of toast.&nbsp; She then left the room as though about to return to
it shortly, but instead of doing so she went into the back kitchen and
hanged herself without a word.&nbsp; It was this which had kept the
house empty so long in spite of its excellent position as a corner shop.&nbsp;
The last tenant had left immediately after the inquest, and if the owner
had had it done up then people would have got over the tragedy that
had been enacted in it, but the combination of bad condition and bad
fame had hindered many from taking it, who like Ellen, could see that
it had great business capabilities.&nbsp; Almost anything would have
sold there, but it happened also that there was no second-hand clothes
shop in close proximity so that everything combined in its favour, except
its filthy state and its reputation.</p>
<p>When I saw it, I thought I would rather die than live in such an
awful place&mdash;but then I had been living in the Temple for the last
five and twenty years.&nbsp; Ernest was lodging in Laystall Street and
had just come out of prison; before this he had lived in Ashpit Place
so that this house had no terrors for him provided he could get it done
up.&nbsp; The difficulty was that the landlord was hard to move in this
respect.&nbsp; It ended in my finding the money to do everything that
was wanted, and taking a lease of the house for five years at the same
rental as that paid by the last occupant.&nbsp; I then sublet it to
Ernest, of course taking care that it was put more efficiently into
repair than his landlord was at all likely to have put it.</p>
<p>A week later I called and found everything so completely transformed
that I should hardly have recognised the house.&nbsp; All the ceilings
had been whitewashed, all the rooms papered, the broken glass hacked
out and reinstated, the defective wood-work renewed, all the sashes,
cupboards and doors had been painted.&nbsp; The drains had been thoroughly
overhauled, everything in fact, that could be done had been done, and
the rooms now looked as cheerful as they had been forbidding when I
had last seen them.&nbsp; The people who had done the repairs were supposed
to have cleaned the house down before leaving, but Ellen had given it
another scrub from top to bottom herself after they were gone, and it
was as clean as a new pin.&nbsp; I almost felt as though I could have
lived in it myself, and as for Ernest, he was in the seventh heaven.&nbsp;
He said it was all my doing and Ellen&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>There was already a counter in the shop and a few fittings, so that
nothing now remained but to get some stock and set them out for sale.&nbsp;
Ernest said he could not begin better than by selling his clerical wardrobe
and his books, for though the shop was intended especially for the sale
of second-hand clothes, yet Ellen said there was no reason why they
should not sell a few books too; so a beginning was to be made by selling
the books he had had at school and college at about one shilling a volume,
taking them all round, and I have heard him say that he learned more
that proved of practical use to him through stocking his books on a
bench in front of his shop and selling them, than he had done from all
the years of study which he had bestowed upon their contents.</p>
<p>For the enquiries that were made of him whether he had such and such
a book taught him what he could sell and what he could not; how much
he could get for this, and how much for that.&nbsp; Having made ever
such a little beginning with books, he took to attending book sales
as well as clothes sales, and ere long this branch of his business became
no less important than the tailoring, and would, I have no doubt, have
been the one which he would have settled down to exclusively, if he
had been called upon to remain a tradesman; but this is anticipating.</p>
<p>I made a contribution and a stipulation.&nbsp; Ernest wanted to sink
the gentleman completely, until such time as he could work his way up
again.&nbsp; If he had been left to himself he would have lived with
Ellen in the shop back parlour and kitchen, and have let out both the
upper floors according to his original programme.&nbsp; I did not want
him, however, to cut himself adrift from music, letters and polite life,
and feared that unless he had some kind of den into which he could retire
he would ere long become the tradesman and nothing else.&nbsp; I therefore
insisted on taking the first floor front and back myself, and furnishing
them with the things which had been left at Mrs Jupp&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
I bought these things of him for a small sum and had them moved into
his present abode.</p>
<p>I went to Mrs Jupp&rsquo;s to arrange all this, as Ernest did not
like going to Ashpit Place.&nbsp; I had half expected to find the furniture
sold and Mrs Jupp gone, but it was not so; with all her faults the poor
old woman was perfectly honest.</p>
<p>I told her that Pryer had taken all Ernest&rsquo;s money and run
away with it.&nbsp; She hated Pryer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never knew anyone,&rdquo;
she exclaimed, &ldquo;as white-livered in the face as that Pryer; he
hasn&rsquo;t got an upright vein in his whole body.&nbsp; Why, all that
time when he used to come breakfasting with Mr Pontifex morning after
morning, it took me to a perfect shadow the way he carried on.&nbsp;
There was no doing anything to please him right.&nbsp; First I used
to get them eggs and bacon, and he didn&rsquo;t like that; and then
I got him a bit of fish, and he didn&rsquo;t like that, or else it was
too dear, and you know fish is dearer than ever; and then I got him
a bit of German, and he said it rose on him; then I tried sausages,
and he said they hit him in the eye worse even than German; oh! how
I used to wander my room and fret about it inwardly and cry for hours,
and all about them paltry breakfasts&mdash;and it wasn&rsquo;t Mr Pontifex;
he&rsquo;d like anything that anyone chose to give him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so the piano&rsquo;s to go,&rdquo; she continued.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What beautiful tunes Mr Pontifex did play upon it, to be sure;
and there was one I liked better than any I ever heard.&nbsp; I was
in the room when he played it once and when I said, &lsquo;Oh, Mr Pontifex,
that&rsquo;s the kind of woman I am,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;No, Mrs
Jupp, it isn&rsquo;t, for this tune is old, but no one can say you are
old.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, bless you, he meant nothing by it, it was only
his mucky flattery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like myself, she was vexed at his getting married.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t
like his being married, and she didn&rsquo;t like his not being married&mdash;but,
anyhow, it was Ellen&rsquo;s fault, not his, and she hoped he would
be happy.&nbsp; &ldquo;But after all,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;it
ain&rsquo;t you and it ain&rsquo;t me, and it ain&rsquo;t him and it
ain&rsquo;t her.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s what you must call the fortunes of
matterimony, for there ain&rsquo;t no other word for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the course of the afternoon the furniture arrived at Ernest&rsquo;s
new abode.&nbsp; In the first floor we placed the piano, table, pictures,
bookshelves, a couple of arm-chairs, and all the little household gods
which he had brought from Cambridge.&nbsp; The back room was furnished
exactly as his bedroom at Ashpit Place had been&mdash;new things being
got for the bridal apartment downstairs.&nbsp; These two first-floor
rooms I insisted on retaining as my own, but Ernest was to use them
whenever he pleased; he was never to sublet even the bedroom, but was
to keep it for himself in case his wife should be ill at any time, or
in case he might be ill himself.</p>
<p>In less than a fortnight from the time of his leaving prison all
these arrangements had been completed, and Ernest felt that he had again
linked himself on to the life which he had led before his imprisonment&mdash;with
a few important differences, however, which were greatly to his advantage.&nbsp;
He was no longer a clergyman; he was about to marry a woman to whom
he was much attached, and he had parted company for ever with his father
and mother.</p>
<p>True, he had lost all his money, his reputation, and his position
as a gentleman; he had, in fact, had to burn his house down in order
to get his roast sucking pig; but if asked whether he would rather be
as he was now or as he was on the day before his arrest, he would not
have had a moment&rsquo;s hesitation in preferring his present to his
past.&nbsp; If his present could only have been purchased at the expense
of all that he had gone through, it was still worth purchasing at the
price, and he would go through it all again if necessary.&nbsp; The
loss of the money was the worst, but Ellen said she was sure they would
get on, and she knew all about it.&nbsp; As for the loss of reputation&mdash;considering
that he had Ellen and me left, it did not come to much.</p>
<p>I saw the house on the afternoon of the day on which all was finished,
and there remained nothing but to buy some stock and begin selling.&nbsp;
When I was gone, after he had had his tea, he stole up to his castle&mdash;the
first floor front.&nbsp; He lit his pipe and sat down to the piano.&nbsp;
He played Handel for an hour or so, and then set himself to the table
to read and write.&nbsp; He took all his sermons and all the theological
works he had begun to compose during the time he had been a clergyman
and put them in the fire; as he saw them consume he felt as though he
had got rid of another incubus.&nbsp; Then he took up some of the little
pieces he had begun to write during the latter part of his undergraduate
life at Cambridge, and began to cut them about and re-write them.&nbsp;
As he worked quietly at these till he heard the clock strike ten and
it was time to go to bed, he felt that he was now not only happy but
supremely happy.</p>
<p>Next day Ellen took him to Debenham&rsquo;s auction rooms, and they
surveyed the lots of clothes which were hung up all round the auction
room to be viewed.&nbsp; Ellen had had sufficient experience to know
about how much each lot ought to fetch; she overhauled lot after lot,
and valued it; in a very short time Ernest himself began to have a pretty
fair idea what each lot should go for, and before the morning was over
valued a dozen lots running at prices about which Ellen said he would
not hurt if he could get them for that.</p>
<p>So far from disliking this work or finding it tedious, he liked it
very much, indeed he would have liked anything which did not overtax
his physical strength, and which held out a prospect of bringing him
in money.&nbsp; Ellen would not let him buy anything on the occasion
of this sale; she said he had better see one sale first and watch how
prices actually went.&nbsp; So at twelve o&rsquo;clock when the sale
began, he saw the lots sold which he and Ellen had marked, and by the
time the sale was over he knew enough to be able to bid with safety
whenever he should actually want to buy.&nbsp; Knowledge of this sort
is very easily acquired by anyone who is in <i>bona fide</i> want of
it.</p>
<p>But Ellen did not want him to buy at auctions&mdash;not much at least
at present.&nbsp; Private dealing, she said, was best.&nbsp; If I, for
example, had any cast-off clothes, he was to buy them from my laundress,
and get a connection with other laundresses, to whom he might give a
trifle more than they got at present for whatever clothes their masters
might give them, and yet make a good profit.&nbsp; If gentlemen sold
their things, he was to try and get them to sell to him.&nbsp; He flinched
at nothing; perhaps he would have flinched if he had had any idea how
<i>outr&eacute;</i> his proceedings were, but the very ignorance of
the world which had ruined him up till now, by a happy irony began to
work its own cure.&nbsp; If some malignant fairy had meant to curse
him in this respect, she had overdone her malice.&nbsp; He did not know
he was doing anything strange.&nbsp; He only knew that he had no money,
and must provide for himself, a wife, and a possible family.&nbsp; More
than this, he wanted to have some leisure in an evening, so that he
might read and write and keep up his music.&nbsp; If anyone would show
him how he could do better than he was doing, he should be much obliged
to them, but to himself it seemed that he was doing sufficiently well;
for at the end of the first week the pair found they had made a clear
profit of &pound;3.&nbsp; In a few weeks this had increased to &pound;4,
and by the New Year they had made a profit of &pound;5 in one week.</p>
<p>Ernest had by this time been married some two months, for he had
stuck to his original plan of marrying Ellen on the first day he could
legally do so.&nbsp; This date was a little delayed by the change of
abode from Laystall Street to Blackfriars, but on the first day that
it could be done it was done.&nbsp; He had never had more than &pound;250
a year, even in the times of his affluence, so that a profit of &pound;5
a week, if it could be maintained steadily, would place him where he
had been as far as income went, and, though he should have to feed two
mouths instead of one, yet his expenses in other ways were so much curtailed
by his changed social position, that, take it all round, his income
was practically what it had been a twelvemonth before.&nbsp; The next
thing to do was to increase it, and put by money.</p>
<p>Prosperity depends, as we all know, in great measure upon energy
and good sense, but it also depends not a little upon pure luck&mdash;that
is to say, upon connections which are in such a tangle that it is more
easy to say that they do not exist, than to try to trace them.&nbsp;
A neighbourhood may have an excellent reputation as being likely to
be a rising one, and yet may become suddenly eclipsed by another, which
no one would have thought so promising.&nbsp; A fever hospital may divert
the stream of business, or a new station attract it; so little, indeed,
can be certainly known, that it is better not to try to know more than
is in everybody&rsquo;s mouth, and to leave the rest to chance.</p>
<p>Luck, which certainly had not been too kind to my hero hitherto,
now seemed to have taken him under her protection.&nbsp; The neighbourhood
prospered, and he with it.&nbsp; It seemed as though he no sooner bought
a thing and put it into his shop, than it sold with a profit of from
thirty to fifty per cent.&nbsp; He learned book-keeping, and watched
his accounts carefully, following up any success immediately; he began
to buy other things besides clothes&mdash;such as books, music, odds
and ends of furniture, etc.&nbsp; Whether it was luck or business aptitude,
or energy, or the politeness with which he treated all his customers,
I cannot say&mdash;but to the surprise of no one more than himself,
he went ahead faster than he had anticipated, even in his wildest dreams,
and by Easter was established in a strong position as the owner of a
business which was bringing him in between four and five hundred a year,
and which he understood how to extend.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXIII</h2>
<p>Ellen and he got on capitally, all the better, perhaps, because the
disparity between them was so great, that neither did Ellen want to
be elevated, nor did Ernest want to elevate her.&nbsp; He was very fond
of her, and very kind to her; they had interests which they could serve
in common; they had antecedents with a good part of which each was familiar;
they had each of them excellent tempers, and this was enough.&nbsp;
Ellen did not seem jealous at Ernest&rsquo;s preferring to sit the greater
part of his time after the day&rsquo;s work was done in the first floor
front where I occasionally visited him.&nbsp; She might have come and
sat with him if she had liked, but, somehow or other, she generally
found enough to occupy her down below.&nbsp; She had the tact also to
encourage him to go out of an evening whenever he had a mind, without
in the least caring that he should take her too&mdash;and this suited
Ernest very well.&nbsp; He was, I should say, much happier in his married
life than people generally are.</p>
<p>At first it had been very painful to him to meet any of his old friends,
as he sometimes accidentally did, but this soon passed; either they
cut him, or he cut them; it was not nice being cut for the first time
or two, but after that, it became rather pleasant than not, and when
he began to see that he was going ahead, he cared very little what people
might say about his antecedents.&nbsp; The ordeal is a painful one,
but if a man&rsquo;s moral and intellectual constitution are naturally
sound, there is nothing which will give him so much strength of character
as having been well cut.</p>
<p>It was easy for him to keep his expenditure down, for his tastes
were not luxurious.&nbsp; He liked theatres, outings into the country
on a Sunday, and tobacco, but he did not care for much else, except
writing and music.&nbsp; As for the usual run of concerts, he hated
them.&nbsp; He worshipped Handel; he liked Offenbach, and the airs that
went about the streets, but he cared for nothing between these two extremes.&nbsp;
Music, therefore, cost him little.&nbsp; As for theatres, I got him
and Ellen as many orders as they liked, so these cost them nothing.&nbsp;
The Sunday outings were a small item; for a shilling or two he could
get a return ticket to some place far enough out of town to give him
a good walk and a thorough change for the day.&nbsp; Ellen went with
him the first few times, but she said she found it too much for her,
there were a few of her old friends whom she should sometimes like to
see, and they and he, she said, would not hit it off perhaps too well,
so it would be better for him to go alone.&nbsp; This seemed so sensible,
and suited Ernest so exactly that he readily fell into it, nor did he
suspect dangers which were apparent enough to me when I heard how she
had treated the matter.&nbsp; I kept silence, however, and for a time
all continued to go well.&nbsp; As I have said, one of his chief pleasures
was in writing.&nbsp; If a man carries with him a little sketch book
and is continually jotting down sketches, he has the artistic instinct;
a hundred things may hinder his due development, but the instinct is
there.&nbsp; The literary instinct may be known by a man&rsquo;s keeping
a small note-book in his waistcoat pocket, into which he jots down anything
that strikes him, or any good thing that he hears said, or a reference
to any passage which he thinks will come in useful to him.&nbsp; Ernest
had such a note-book always with him.&nbsp; Even when he was at Cambridge
he had begun the practice without anyone&rsquo;s having suggested it
to him.&nbsp; These notes he copied out from time to time into a book,
which as they accumulated, he was driven into indexing approximately,
as he went along.&nbsp; When I found out this, I knew that he had the
literary instinct, and when I saw his notes I began to hope great things
of him.</p>
<p>For a long time I was disappointed.&nbsp; He was kept back by the
nature of the subjects he chose&mdash;which were generally metaphysical.&nbsp;
In vain I tried to get him away from these to matters which had a greater
interest for the general public.&nbsp; When I begged him to try his
hand at some pretty, graceful, little story which should be full of
whatever people knew and liked best, he would immediately set to work
upon a treatise to show the grounds on which all belief rested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are stirring mud,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;or poking at a
sleeping dog.&nbsp; You are trying to make people resume consciousness
about things, which, with sensible men, have already passed into the
unconscious stage.&nbsp; The men whom you would disturb are in front
of you, and not, as you fancy, behind you; it is you who are the lagger,
not they.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not see it.&nbsp; He said he was engaged on an essay upon
the famous <i>quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus</i> of St Vincent
de Lerins.&nbsp; This was the more provoking because he showed himself
able to do better things if he had liked.</p>
<p>I was then at work upon my burlesque &ldquo;The Impatient Griselda,&rdquo;
and was sometimes at my wits&rsquo; end for a piece of business or a
situation; he gave me many suggestions, all of which were marked by
excellent good sense.&nbsp; Nevertheless I could not prevail with him
to put philosophy on one side, and was obliged to leave him to himself.</p>
<p>For a long time, as I have said, his choice of subjects continued
to be such as I could not approve.&nbsp; He was continually studying
scientific and metaphysical writers, in the hope of either finding or
making for himself a philosopher&rsquo;s stone in the shape of a system
which should go on all fours under all circumstances, instead of being
liable to be upset at every touch and turn, as every system yet promulgated
has turned out to be.</p>
<p>He kept to the pursuit of this will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp so long that
I gave up hope, and set him down as another fly that had been caught,
as it were, by a piece of paper daubed over with some sticky stuff that
had not even the merit of being sweet, but to my surprise he at last
declared that he was satisfied, and had found what he wanted.</p>
<p>I supposed that he had only hit upon some new &ldquo;Lo, here!&rdquo;
when to my relief, he told me that he had concluded that no system which
should go perfectly upon all fours was possible, inasmuch as no one
could get behind Bishop Berkeley, and therefore no absolutely incontrovertible
first premise could ever be laid.&nbsp; Having found this he was just
as well pleased as if he had found the most perfect system imaginable.&nbsp;
All he wanted he said, was to know which way it was to be&mdash;that
is to say whether a system was possible or not, and if possible then
what the system was to be.&nbsp; Having found out that no system based
on absolute certainty was possible he was contented.</p>
<p>I had only a very vague idea who Bishop Berkeley was, but was thankful
to him for having defended us from an incontrovertible first premise.&nbsp;
I am afraid I said a few words implying that after a great deal of trouble
he had arrived at the conclusion which sensible people reach without
bothering their brains so much.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;Yes, but I was not born sensible.&nbsp; A child of
ordinary powers learns to walk at a year or two old without knowing
much about it; failing ordinary powers he had better learn laboriously
than never learn at all.&nbsp; I am sorry I was not stronger, but to
do as I did was my only chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked so meek that I was vexed with myself for having said what
I had, more especially when I remembered his bringing-up, which had
doubtless done much to impair his power of taking a common-sense view
of things.&nbsp; He continued&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it all now.&nbsp; The people like Towneley are the only
ones who know anything that is worth knowing, and like that of course
I can never be.&nbsp; But to make Towneleys possible there must be hewers
of wood and drawers of water&mdash;men in fact through whom conscious
knowledge must pass before it can reach those who can apply it gracefully
and instinctively as the Towneleys can.&nbsp; I am a hewer of wood,
but if I accept the position frankly and do not set up to be a Towneley,
it does not matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He still, therefore, stuck to science instead of turning to literature
proper as I hoped he would have done, but he confined himself henceforth
to enquiries on specific subjects concerning which an increase of our
knowledge&mdash;as he said&mdash;was possible.&nbsp; Having in fact,
after infinite vexation of spirit, arrived at a conclusion which cut
at the roots of all knowledge, he settled contentedly down to the pursuit
of knowledge, and has pursued it ever since in spite of occasional excursions
into the regions of literature proper.</p>
<p>But this is anticipating, and may perhaps also convey a wrong impression,
for from the outset he did occasionally turn his attention to work which
must be more properly called literary than either scientific or metaphysical.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXIV</h2>
<p>About six months after he had set up his shop his prosperity had
reached its climax.&nbsp; It seemed even then as though he were likely
to go ahead no less fast than heretofore, and I doubt not that he would
have done so, if success or non-success had depended upon himself alone.&nbsp;
Unfortunately he was not the only person to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>One morning he had gone out to attend some sales, leaving his wife
perfectly well, as usual in good spirits, and looking very pretty.&nbsp;
When he came back he found her sitting on a chair in the back parlour,
with her hair over her face, sobbing and crying as though her heart
would break.&nbsp; She said she had been frightened in the morning by
a man who had pretended to be a customer, and had threatened her unless
she gave him some things, and she had had to give them to him in order
to save herself from violence; she had been in hysterics ever since
the man had gone.&nbsp; This was her story, but her speech was so incoherent
that it was not easy to make out what she said.&nbsp; Ernest knew she
was with child, and thinking this might have something to do with the
matter, would have sent for a doctor if Ellen had not begged him not
to do so.</p>
<p>Anyone who had had experience of drunken people would have seen at
a glance what the matter was, but my hero knew nothing about them&mdash;nothing,
that is to say, about the drunkenness of the habitual drunkard, which
shows itself very differently from that of one who gets drunk only once
in a way.&nbsp; The idea that his wife could drink had never even crossed
his mind, indeed she always made a fuss about taking more than a very
little beer, and never touched spirits.&nbsp; He did not know much more
about hysterics than he did about drunkenness, but he had always heard
that women who were about to become mothers were liable to be easily
upset and were often rather flighty, so he was not greatly surprised,
and thought he had settled the matter by registering the discovery that
being about to become a father has its troublesome as well as its pleasant
side.</p>
<p>The great change in Ellen&rsquo;s life consequent upon her meeting
Ernest and getting married had for a time actually sobered her by shaking
her out of her old ways.&nbsp; Drunkenness is so much a matter of habit,
and habit so much a matter of surroundings, that if you completely change
the surroundings you will sometimes get rid of the drunkenness altogether.&nbsp;
Ellen had intended remaining always sober henceforward, and never having
had so long a steady fit before, believed she was now cured.&nbsp; So
she perhaps would have been if she had seen none of her old acquaintances.&nbsp;
When, however, her new life was beginning to lose its newness, and when
her old acquaintances came to see her, her present surroundings became
more like her past, and on this she herself began to get like her past
too.&nbsp; At first she only got a little tipsy and struggled against
a relapse; but it was no use, she soon lost the heart to fight, and
now her object was not to try and keep sober, but to get gin without
her husband&rsquo;s finding it out.</p>
<p>So the hysterics continued, and she managed to make her husband still
think that they were due to her being about to become a mother.&nbsp;
The worse her attacks were, the more devoted he became in his attention
to her.&nbsp; At last he insisted that a doctor should see her.&nbsp;
The doctor of course took in the situation at a glance, but said nothing
to Ernest except in such a guarded way that he did not understand the
hints that were thrown out to him.&nbsp; He was much too downright and
matter of fact to be quick at taking hints of this sort.&nbsp; He hoped
that as soon as his wife&rsquo;s confinement was over she would regain
her health and had no thought save how to spare her as far as possible
till that happy time should come.</p>
<p>In the mornings she was generally better, as long that is to say
as Ernest remained at home; but he had to go out buying, and on his
return would generally find that she had had another attack as soon
as he had left the house.&nbsp; At times she would laugh and cry for
half an hour together, at others she would lie in a semi-comatose state
upon the bed, and when he came back he would find that the shop had
been neglected and all the work of the household left undone.&nbsp;
Still he took it for granted that this was all part of the usual course
when women were going to become mothers, and when Ellen&rsquo;s share
of the work settled down more and more upon his own shoulders he did
it all and drudged away without a murmur.&nbsp; Nevertheless, he began
to feel in a vague way more as he had felt in Ashpit Place, at Roughborough,
or at Battersby, and to lose the buoyancy of spirits which had made
another man of him during the first six months of his married life.</p>
<p>It was not only that he had to do so much household work, for even
the cooking, cleaning up slops, bed-making and fire-lighting ere long
devolved upon him, but his business no longer prospered.&nbsp; He could
buy as hitherto, but Ellen seemed unable to sell as she had sold at
first.&nbsp; The fact was that she sold as well as ever, but kept back
part of the proceeds in order to buy gin, and she did this more and
more till even the unsuspecting Ernest ought to have seen that she was
not telling the truth.&nbsp; When she sold better&mdash;that is to say
when she did not think it safe to keep back more than a certain amount,
she got money out of him on the plea that she had a longing for this
or that, and that it would perhaps irreparably damage the baby if her
longing was denied her.&nbsp; All seemed right, reasonable, and unavoidable,
nevertheless Ernest saw that until the confinement was over he was likely
to have a hard time of it.&nbsp; All however would then come right again.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXV</h2>
<p>In the month of September 1860 a girl was born, and Ernest was proud
and happy.&nbsp; The birth of the child, and a rather alarming talk
which the doctor had given to Ellen sobered her for a few weeks, and
it really seemed as though his hopes were about to be fulfilled.&nbsp;
The expenses of his wife&rsquo;s confinement were heavy, and he was
obliged to trench upon his savings, but he had no doubt about soon recouping
this now that Ellen was herself again; for a time indeed his business
did revive a little, nevertheless it seemed as though the interruption
to his prosperity had in some way broken the spell of good luck which
had attended him in the outset; he was still sanguine, however, and
worked night and day with a will, but there was no more music, or reading,
or writing now.&nbsp; His Sunday outings were put a stop to, and but
for the first floor being let to myself, he would have lost his citadel
there too, but he seldom used it, for Ellen had to wait more and more
upon the baby, and, as a consequence, Ernest had to wait more and more
upon Ellen.</p>
<p>One afternoon, about a couple of months after the baby had been born,
and just as my unhappy hero was beginning to feel more hopeful and therefore
better able to bear his burdens, he returned from a sale, and found
Ellen in the same hysterical condition that he had found her in in the
spring.&nbsp; She said she was again with child, and Ernest still believed
her.</p>
<p>All the troubles of the preceding six months began again then and
there, and grew worse and worse continually.&nbsp; Money did not come
in quickly, for Ellen cheated him by keeping it back, and dealing improperly
with the goods he bought.&nbsp; When it did come in she got it out of
him as before on pretexts which it seemed inhuman to inquire into.&nbsp;
It was always the same story.&nbsp; By and by a new feature began to
show itself.&nbsp; Ernest had inherited his father&rsquo;s punctuality
and exactness as regards money; he liked to know the worst of what he
had to pay at once; he hated having expenses sprung upon him which if
not foreseen might and ought to have been so, but now bills began to
be brought to him for things ordered by Ellen without his knowledge,
or for which he had already given her the money.&nbsp; This was awful,
and even Ernest turned.&nbsp; When he remonstrated with her&mdash;not
for having bought the things, but for having said nothing to him about
the moneys being owing&mdash;Ellen met him with hysteria and there was
a scene.&nbsp; She had now pretty well forgotten the hard times she
had known when she had been on her own resources and reproached him
downright with having married her&mdash;on that moment the scales fell
from Ernest&rsquo;s eyes as they had fallen when Towneley had said,
&ldquo;No, no, no.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said nothing, but he woke up once
for all to the fact that he had made a mistake in marrying.&nbsp; A
touch had again come which had revealed him to himself.</p>
<p>He went upstairs to the disused citadel, flung himself into the arm-chair,
and covered his face with his hands.</p>
<p>He still did not know that his wife drank, but he could no longer
trust her, and his dream of happiness was over.&nbsp; He had been saved
from the Church&mdash;so as by fire, but still saved&mdash;but what
could now save him from his marriage?&nbsp; He had made the same mistake
that he had made in wedding himself to the Church, but with a hundred
times worse results.&nbsp; He had learnt nothing by experience: he was
an Esau&mdash;one of those wretches whose hearts the Lord had hardened,
who, having ears, heard not, having eyes saw not, and who should find
no place for repentance though they sought it even with tears.</p>
<p>Yet had he not on the whole tried to find out what the ways of God
were, and to follow them in singleness of heart?&nbsp; To a certain
extent, yes; but he had not been thorough; he had not given up all for
God.&nbsp; He knew that very well he had done little as compared with
what he might and ought to have done, but still if he was being punished
for this, God was a hard taskmaster, and one, too, who was continually
pouncing out upon his unhappy creatures from ambuscades.&nbsp; In marrying
Ellen he had meant to avoid a life of sin, and to take the course he
believed to be moral and right.&nbsp; With his antecedents and surroundings
it was the most natural thing in the world for him to have done, yet
in what a frightful position had not his morality landed him.&nbsp;
Could any amount of immorality have placed him in a much worse one?&nbsp;
What was morality worth if it was not that which on the whole brought
a man peace at the last, and could anyone have reasonable certainty
that marriage would do this?&nbsp; It seemed to him that in his attempt
to be moral he had been following a devil which had disguised itself
as an angel of light.&nbsp; But if so, what ground was there on which
a man might rest the sole of his foot and tread in reasonable safety?</p>
<p>He was still too young to reach the answer, &ldquo;On common sense&rdquo;&mdash;an
answer which he would have felt to be unworthy of anyone who had an
ideal standard.</p>
<p>However this might be, it was plain that he had now done for himself.&nbsp;
It had been thus with him all his life.&nbsp; If there had come at any
time a gleam of sunshine and hope, it was to be obscured immediately&mdash;why,
prison was happier than this!&nbsp; There, at any rate, he had had no
money anxieties, and these were beginning to weigh upon him now with
all their horrors.&nbsp; He was happier even now than he had been at
Battersby or at Roughborough, and he would not now go back, even if
he could, to his Cambridge life, but for all that the outlook was so
gloomy, in fact so hopeless, that he felt as if he could have only too
gladly gone to sleep and died in his arm-chair once for all.</p>
<p>As he was musing thus and looking upon the wreck of his hopes&mdash;for
he saw well enough that as long as he was linked to Ellen he should
never rise as he had dreamed of doing&mdash;he heard a noise below,
and presently a neighbour ran upstairs and entered his room hurriedly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, Mr Pontifex,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;for
goodness&rsquo; sake come down quickly and help.&nbsp; O Mrs Pontifex
is took with the horrors&mdash;and she&rsquo;s orkard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unhappy man came down as he was bid and found his wife mad with
<i>delirium tremens</i>.</p>
<p>He knew all now.&nbsp; The neighbours thought he must have known
that his wife drank all along, but Ellen had been so artful, and he
so simple, that, as I have said, he had had no suspicion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo;
said the woman who had summoned him, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll drink anything
she can stand up and pay her money for.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ernest could hardly
believe his ears, but when the doctor had seen his wife and she had
become more quiet, he went over to the public house hard by and made
enquiries, the result of which rendered further doubt impossible.&nbsp;
The publican took the opportunity to present my hero with a bill of
several pounds for bottles of spirits supplied to his wife, and what
with his wife&rsquo;s confinement and the way business had fallen off,
he had not the money to pay with, for the sum exceeded the remnant of
his savings.</p>
<p>He came to me&mdash;not for money, but to tell me his miserable story.&nbsp;
I had seen for some time that there was something wrong, and had suspected
pretty shrewdly what the matter was, but of course I said nothing.&nbsp;
Ernest and I had been growing apart for some time.&nbsp; I was vexed
at his having married, and he knew I was vexed, though I did my best
to hide it.</p>
<p>A man&rsquo;s friendships are, like his will, invalidated by marriage&mdash;but
they are also no less invalidated by the marriage of his friends.&nbsp;
The rift in friendship which invariably makes its appearance on the
marriage of either of the parties to it was fast widening, as it no
less invariably does, into the great gulf which is fixed between the
married and the unmarried, and I was beginning to leave my <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>
to a fate with which I had neither right nor power to meddle.&nbsp;
In fact I had begun to feel him rather a burden; I did not so much mind
this when I could be of use, but I grudged it when I could be of none.&nbsp;
He had made his bed and he must lie upon it.&nbsp; Ernest had felt all
this and had seldom come near me till now, one evening late in 1860,
he called on me, and with a very woebegone face told me his troubles.</p>
<p>As soon as I found that he no longer liked his wife I forgave him
at once, and was as much interested in him as ever.&nbsp; There is nothing
an old bachelor likes better than to find a young married man who wishes
he had not got married&mdash;especially when the case is such an extreme
one that he need not pretend to hope that matters will come all right
again, or encourage his young friend to make the best of it.</p>
<p>I was myself in favour of a separation, and said I would make Ellen
an allowance myself&mdash;of course intending that it should come out
of Ernest&rsquo;s money; but he would not hear of this.&nbsp; He had
married Ellen, he said, and he must try to reform her.&nbsp; He hated
it, but he must try; and finding him as usual very obstinate I was obliged
to acquiesce, though with little confidence as to the result.&nbsp;
I was vexed at seeing him waste himself upon such a barren task, and
again began to feel him burdensome.&nbsp; I am afraid I showed this,
for he again avoided me for some time, and, indeed, for many months
I hardly saw him at all.</p>
<p>Ellen remained very ill for some days, and then gradually recovered.&nbsp;
Ernest hardly left her till she was out of danger.&nbsp; When she had
recovered he got the doctor to tell her that if she had such another
attack she would certainly die; this so frightened her that she took
the pledge.</p>
<p>Then he became more hopeful again.&nbsp; When she was sober she was
just what she was during the first days of her married life, and so
quick was he to forget pain, that after a few days he was as fond of
her as ever.&nbsp; But Ellen could not forgive him for knowing what
he did.&nbsp; She knew that he was on the watch to shield her from temptation,
and though he did his best to make her think that he had no further
uneasiness about her, she found the burden of her union with respectability
grow more and more heavy upon her, and looked back more and more longingly
upon the lawless freedom of the life she had led before she met her
husband.</p>
<p>I will dwell no longer on this part of my story.&nbsp; During the
spring months of 1861 she kept straight&mdash;she had had her fling
of dissipation, and this, together with the impression made upon her
by her having taken the pledge, tamed her for a while.&nbsp; The shop
went fairly well, and enabled Ernest to make the two ends meet.&nbsp;
In the spring and summer of 1861 he even put by a little money again.&nbsp;
In the autumn his wife was confined of a boy&mdash;a very fine one,
so everyone said.&nbsp; She soon recovered, and Ernest was beginning
to breathe freely and be almost sanguine when, without a word of warning,
the storm broke again.&nbsp; He returned one afternoon about two years
after his marriage, and found his wife lying upon the floor insensible.</p>
<p>From this time he became hopeless, and began to go visibly down hill.&nbsp;
He had been knocked about too much, and the luck had gone too long against
him.&nbsp; The wear and tear of the last three years had told on him,
and though not actually ill he was overworked, below par, and unfit
for any further burden.</p>
<p>He struggled for a while to prevent himself from finding this out,
but facts were too strong for him.&nbsp; Again he called on me and told
me what had happened.&nbsp; I was glad the crisis had come; I was sorry
for Ellen, but a complete separation from her was the only chance for
her husband.&nbsp; Even after this last outbreak he was unwilling to
consent to this, and talked nonsense about dying at his post, till I
got tired of him.&nbsp; Each time I saw him the old gloom had settled
more and more deeply upon his face, and I had about made up my mind
to put an end to the situation by a <i>coup de main</i>, such as bribing
Ellen to run away with somebody else, or something of that kind, when
matters settled themselves as usual in a way which I had not anticipated.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXVI</h2>
<p>The winter had been a trying one.&nbsp; Ernest had only paid his
way by selling his piano.&nbsp; With this he seemed to cut away the
last link that connected him with his earlier life, and to sink once
for all into the small shop-keeper.&nbsp; It seemed to him that however
low he might sink his pain could not last much longer, for he should
simply die if it did.</p>
<p>He hated Ellen now, and the pair lived in open want of harmony with
each other.&nbsp; If it had not been for his children, he would have
left her and gone to America, but he could not leave the children with
Ellen, and as for taking them with him he did not know how to do it,
nor what to do with them when he had got them to America.&nbsp; If he
had not lost energy he would probably in the end have taken the children
and gone off, but his nerve was shaken, so day after day went by and
nothing was done.</p>
<p>He had only got a few shillings in the world now, except the value
of his stock, which was very little; he could get perhaps &pound;3 or
&pound;4 by selling his music and what few pictures and pieces of furniture
still belonged to him.&nbsp; He thought of trying to live by his pen,
but his writing had dropped off long ago; he no longer had an idea in
his head.&nbsp; Look which way he would he saw no hope; the end, if
it had not actually come, was within easy distance and he was almost
face to face with actual want.&nbsp; When he saw people going about
poorly clad, or even without shoes and stockings, he wondered whether
within a few months&rsquo; time he too should not have to go about in
this way.&nbsp; The remorseless, resistless hand of fate had caught
him in its grip and was dragging him down, down, down.&nbsp; Still he
staggered on, going his daily rounds, buying second-hand clothes, and
spending his evenings in cleaning and mending them.</p>
<p>One morning, as he was returning from a house at the West End where
he had bought some clothes from one of the servants, he was struck by
a small crowd which had gathered round a space that had been railed
off on the grass near one of the paths in the Green Park.</p>
<p>It was a lovely soft spring morning at the end of March, and unusually
balmy for the time of year; even Ernest&rsquo;s melancholy was relieved
for a while by the look of spring that pervaded earth and sky; but it
soon returned, and smiling sadly he said to himself: &ldquo;It may bring
hope to others, but for me there can be no hope henceforth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As these words were in his mind he joined the small crowd who were
gathered round the railings, and saw that they were looking at three
sheep with very small lambs only a day or two old, which had been penned
off for shelter and protection from the others that ranged the park.</p>
<p>They were very pretty, and Londoners so seldom get a chance of seeing
lambs that it was no wonder every one stopped to look at them.&nbsp;
Ernest observed that no one seemed fonder of them than a great lubberly
butcher boy, who leaned up against the railings with a tray of meat
upon his shoulder.&nbsp; He was looking at this boy and smiling at the
grotesqueness of his admiration, when he became aware that he was being
watched intently by a man in coachman&rsquo;s livery, who had also stopped
to admire the lambs, and was leaning against the opposite side of the
enclosure.&nbsp; Ernest knew him in a moment as John, his father&rsquo;s
old coachman at Battersby, and went up to him at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Master Ernest,&rdquo; said he, with his strong northern
accent, &ldquo;I was thinking of you only this very morning,&rdquo;
and the pair shook hands heartily.&nbsp; John was in an excellent place
at the West End.&nbsp; He had done very well, he said, ever since he
had left Battersby, except for the first year or two, and that, he said,
with a screw of the face, had well nigh broke him.</p>
<p>Ernest asked how this was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you see,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;I was always main fond
of that lass Ellen, whom you remember running after, Master Ernest,
and giving your watch to.&nbsp; I expect you haven&rsquo;t forgotten
that day, have you?&rdquo;&nbsp; And here he laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know as I be the father of the child she carried away with
her from Battersby, but I very easily may have been.&nbsp; Anyhow, after
I had left your papa&rsquo;s place a few days I wrote to Ellen to an
address we had agreed upon, and told her I would do what I ought to
do, and so I did, for I married her within a month afterwards.&nbsp;
Why, Lord love the man, whatever is the matter with him?&rdquo;&mdash;for
as he had spoken the last few words of his story Ernest had turned white
as a sheet, and was leaning against the railings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; said my hero, gasping for breath, &ldquo;are
you sure of what you say&mdash;are you quite sure you really married
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;I married her before
the registrar at Letchbury on the 15th of August 1851.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me your arm,&rdquo; said Ernest, &ldquo;and take me into
Piccadilly, and put me into a cab, and come with me at once, if you
can spare time, to Mr Overton&rsquo;s at the Temple.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXVII</h2>
<p>I do not think Ernest himself was much more pleased at finding that
he had never been married than I was.&nbsp; To him, however, the shock
of pleasure was positively numbing in its intensity.&nbsp; As he felt
his burden removed, he reeled for the unaccustomed lightness of his
movements; his position was so shattered that his identity seemed to
have been shattered also; he was as one waking up from a horrible nightmare
to find himself safe and sound in bed, but who can hardly even yet believe
that the room is not full of armed men who are about to spring upon
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is I,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who not an hour ago complained
that I was without hope.&nbsp; It is I, who for weeks have been railing
at fortune, and saying that though she smiled on others she never smiled
at me.&nbsp; Why, never was anyone half so fortunate as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you have been inoculated for marriage,
and have recovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was very fond of her till
she took to drinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps; but is it not Tennyson who has said: &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis
better to have loved and lost, than never to have lost at all&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an inveterate bachelor,&rdquo; was the rejoinder.</p>
<p>Then we had a long talk with John, to whom I gave a &pound;5 note
upon the spot.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;Ellen had used to drink at Battersby;
the cook had taught her; he had known it, but was so fond of her, that
he had chanced it and married her to save her from the streets and in
the hope of being able to keep her straight.&nbsp; She had done with
him just as she had done with Ernest&mdash;made him an excellent wife
as long as she kept sober, but a very bad one afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;a sweeter-tempered,
handier, prettier girl than she was in all England, nor one as knows
better what a man likes, and how to make him happy, if you can keep
her from drink; but you can&rsquo;t keep her; she&rsquo;s that artful
she&rsquo;ll get it under your very eyes, without you knowing it.&nbsp;
If she can&rsquo;t get any more of your things to pawn or sell, she&rsquo;ll
steal her neighbours&rsquo;.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how she got into trouble
first when I was with her.&nbsp; During the six months she was in prison
I should have felt happy if I had not known she would come out again.&nbsp;
And then she did come out, and before she had been free a fortnight,
she began shop-lifting and going on the loose again&mdash;and all to
get money to drink with.&nbsp; So seeing I could do nothing with her
and that she was just a-killing of me, I left her, and came up to London,
and went into service again, and I did not know what had become of her
till you and Mr Ernest here told me.&nbsp; I hope you&rsquo;ll neither
of you say you&rsquo;ve seen me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We assured him we would keep his counsel, and then he left us, with
many protestations of affection towards Ernest, to whom he had been
always much attached.</p>
<p>We talked the situation over, and decided first to get the children
away, and then to come to terms with Ellen concerning their future custody;
as for herself, I proposed that we should make her an allowance of,
say, a pound a week to be paid so long as she gave no trouble.&nbsp;
Ernest did not see where the pound a week was to come from, so I eased
his mind by saying I would pay it myself.&nbsp; Before the day was two
hours older we had got the children, about whom Ellen had always appeared
to be indifferent, and had confided them to the care of my laundress,
a good motherly sort of woman, who took to them and to whom they took
at once.</p>
<p>Then came the odious task of getting rid of their unhappy mother.&nbsp;
Ernest&rsquo;s heart smote him at the notion of the shock the break-up
would be to her.&nbsp; He was always thinking that people had a claim
upon him for some inestimable service they had rendered him, or for
some irreparable mischief done to them by himself; the case however
was so clear, that Ernest&rsquo;s scruples did not offer serious resistance.</p>
<p>I did not see why he should have the pain of another interview with
his wife, so I got Mr Ottery to manage the whole business.&nbsp; It
turned out that we need not have harrowed ourselves so much about the
agony of mind which Ellen would suffer on becoming an outcast again.&nbsp;
Ernest saw Mrs Richards, the neighbour who had called him down on the
night when he had first discovered his wife&rsquo;s drunkenness, and
got from her some details of Ellen&rsquo;s opinions upon the matter.&nbsp;
She did not seem in the least conscience-stricken; she said: &ldquo;Thank
goodness, at last!&rdquo;&nbsp; And although aware that her marriage
was not a valid one, evidently regarded this as a mere detail which
it would not be worth anybody&rsquo;s while to go into more particularly.&nbsp;
As regards his breaking with her, she said it was a good job both for
him and for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This life,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t suit me.&nbsp;
Ernest is too good for me; he wants a woman as shall be a bit better
than me, and I want a man that shall be a bit worse than him.&nbsp;
We should have got on all very well if we had not lived together as
married folks, but I&rsquo;ve been used to have a little place of my
own, however small, for a many years, and I don&rsquo;t want Ernest,
or any other man, always hanging about it.&nbsp; Besides he is too steady:
his being in prison hasn&rsquo;t done him a bit of good&mdash;he&rsquo;s
just as grave as those as have never been in prison at all, and he never
swears nor curses, come what may; it makes me afeared of him, and therefore
I drink the worse.&nbsp; What us poor girls wants is not to be jumped
up all of a sudden and made honest women of; this is too much for us
and throws us off our perch; what we wants is a regular friend or two,
who&rsquo;ll just keep us from starving, and force us to be good for
a bit together now and again.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s about as much as we
can stand.&nbsp; He may have the children; he can do better for them
than I can; and as for his money, he may give it or keep it as he likes,
he&rsquo;s never done me any harm, and I shall let him alone; but if
he means me to have it, I suppose I&rsquo;d better have it.&rdquo;&mdash;And
have it she did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; thought Ernest to himself again when the arrangement
was concluded, &ldquo;am the man who thought himself unlucky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I may as well say here all that need be said further about Ellen.&nbsp;
For the next three years she used to call regularly at Mr Ottery&rsquo;s
every Monday morning for her pound.&nbsp; She was always neatly dressed,
and looked so quiet and pretty that no one would have suspected her
antecedents.&nbsp; At first she wanted sometimes to anticipate, but
after three or four ineffectual attempts&mdash;on each of which occasions
she told a most pitiful story&mdash;she gave it up and took her money
regularly without a word.&nbsp; Once she came with a bad black eye,
&ldquo;which a boy had throwed a stone and hit her by mistake&rdquo;;
but on the whole she looked pretty much the same at the end of the three
years as she had done at the beginning.&nbsp; Then she explained that
she was going to be married again.&nbsp; Mr Ottery saw her on this,
and pointed out to her that she would very likely be again committing
bigamy by doing so.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may call it what you like,&rdquo;
she replied, &ldquo;but I am going off to America with Bill the butcher&rsquo;s
man, and we hope Mr Pontifex won&rsquo;t be too hard on us and stop
the allowance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ernest was little likely to do this, so
the pair went in peace.&nbsp; I believe it was Bill who had blacked
her eye, and she liked him all the better for it.</p>
<p>From one or two little things I have been able to gather that the
couple got on very well together, and that in Bill she has found a partner
better suited to her than either John or Ernest.&nbsp; On his birthday
Ernest generally receives an envelope with an American post-mark containing
a book-marker with a flaunting text upon it, or a moral kettle-holder,
or some other similar small token of recognition, but no letter.&nbsp;
Of the children she has taken no notice.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXVIII</h2>
<p>Ernest was now well turned twenty-six years old, and in little more
than another year and a half would come into possession of his money.&nbsp;
I saw no reason for letting him have it earlier than the date fixed
by Miss Pontifex herself; at the same time I did not like his continuing
the shop at Blackfriars after the present crisis.&nbsp; It was not till
now that I fully understood how much he had suffered, nor how nearly
his supposed wife&rsquo;s habits had brought him to actual want.</p>
<p>I had indeed noted the old wan worn look settling upon his face,
but was either too indolent or too hopeless of being able to sustain
a protracted and successful warfare with Ellen to extend the sympathy
and make the inquiries which I suppose I ought to have made.&nbsp; And
yet I hardly know what I could have done, for nothing short of his finding
out what he had found out would have detached him from his wife, and
nothing could do him much good as long as he continued to live with
her.</p>
<p>After all I suppose I was right; I suppose things did turn out all
the better in the end for having been left to settle themselves&mdash;at
any rate whether they did or did not, the whole thing was in too great
a muddle for me to venture to tackle it so long as Ellen was upon the
scene; now, however, that she was removed, all my interest in my godson
revived, and I turned over many times in my mind, what I had better
do with him.</p>
<p>It was now three and a half years since he had come up to London
and begun to live, so to speak, upon his own account.&nbsp; Of these
years, six months had been spent as a clergyman, six months in gaol,
and for two and a half years he had been acquiring twofold experience
in the ways of business and of marriage.&nbsp; He had failed, I may
say, in everything that he had undertaken, even as a prisoner; yet his
defeats had been always, as it seemed to me, something so like victories,
that I was satisfied of his being worth all the pains I could bestow
upon him; my only fear was lest I should meddle with him when it might
be better for him to be let alone.&nbsp; On the whole I concluded that
a three and a half years&rsquo; apprenticeship to a rough life was enough;
the shop had done much for him; it had kept him going after a fashion,
when he was in great need; it had thrown him upon his own resources,
and taught him to see profitable openings all around him, where a few
months before he would have seen nothing but insuperable difficulties;
it had enlarged his sympathies by making him understand the lower classes,
and not confining his view of life to that taken by gentlemen only.&nbsp;
When he went about the streets and saw the books outside the second-hand
book-stalls, the bric-a-brac in the curiosity shops, and the infinite
commercial activity which is omnipresent around us, he understood it
and sympathised with it as he could never have done if he had not kept
a shop himself.</p>
<p>He has often told me that when he used to travel on a railway that
overlooked populous suburbs, and looked down upon street after street
of dingy houses, he used to wonder what kind of people lived in them,
what they did and felt, and how far it was like what he did and felt
himself.&nbsp; Now, he said he knew all about it.&nbsp; I am not very
familiar with the writer of the Odyssey (who, by the way, I suspect
strongly of having been a clergyman), but he assuredly hit the right
nail on the head when he epitomised his typical wise man as knowing
&ldquo;the ways and farings of many men.&rdquo;&nbsp; What culture is
comparable to this?&nbsp; What a lie, what a sickly debilitating debauch
did not Ernest&rsquo;s school and university career now seem to him,
in comparison with his life in prison and as a tailor in Blackfriars.&nbsp;
I have heard him say he would have gone through all he had suffered
if it were only for the deeper insight it gave him into the spirit of
the Grecian and the Surrey pantomimes.&nbsp; What confidence again in
his own power to swim if thrown into deep waters had not he won through
his experiences during the last three years!</p>
<p>But, as I have said, I thought my godson had now seen as much of
the under currents of life as was likely to be of use to him, and that
it was time he began to live in a style more suitable to his prospects.&nbsp;
His aunt had wished him to kiss the soil, and he had kissed it with
a vengeance; but I did not like the notion of his coming suddenly from
the position of a small shop-keeper to that of a man with an income
of between three and four thousand a year.&nbsp; Too sudden a jump from
bad fortune to good is just as dangerous as one from good to bad; besides,
poverty is very wearing; it is a quasi-embryonic condition, through
which a man had better pass if he is to hold his later developments
securely, but like measles or scarlet fever he had better have it mildly
and get it over early.</p>
<p>No man is safe from losing every penny he has in the world, unless
he has had his facer.&nbsp; How often do I not hear middle-aged women
and quiet family men say that they have no speculative tendency; <i>they</i>
never had touched, and never would touch, any but the very soundest,
best reputed investments, and as for unlimited liability, oh dear! dear!
and they throw up their hands and eyes.</p>
<p>Whenever a person is heard to talk thus he may be recognised as the
easy prey of the first adventurer who comes across him; he will commonly,
indeed, wind up his discourse by saying that in spite of all his natural
caution, and his well knowing how foolish speculation is, yet there
are some investments which are called speculative but in reality are
not so, and he will pull out of his pocket the prospectus of a Cornish
gold mine.&nbsp; It is only on having actually lost money that one realises
what an awful thing the loss of it is, and finds out how easily it is
lost by those who venture out of the middle of the most beaten path.&nbsp;
Ernest had had his facer, as he had had his attack of poverty, young,
and sufficiently badly for a sensible man to be little likely to forget
it.&nbsp; I can fancy few pieces of good fortune greater than this as
happening to any man, provided, of course, that he is not damaged irretrievably.</p>
<p>So strongly do I feel on this subject that if I had my way I would
have a speculation master attached to every school.&nbsp; The boys would
be encouraged to read the <i>Money Market Review</i>, the <i>Railway
News</i>, and all the best financial papers, and should establish a
stock exchange amongst themselves in which pence should stand as pounds.&nbsp;
Then let them see how this making haste to get rich moneys out in actual
practice.&nbsp; There might be a prize awarded by the head-master to
the most prudent dealer, and the boys who lost their money time after
time should be dismissed.&nbsp; Of course if any boy proved to have
a genius for speculation and made money&mdash;well and good, let him
speculate by all means.</p>
<p>If Universities were not the worst teachers in the world I should
like to see professorships of speculation established at Oxford and
Cambridge.&nbsp; When I reflect, however, that the only things worth
doing which Oxford and Cambridge can do well are cooking, cricket, rowing
and games, of which there is no professorship, I fear that the establishment
of a professorial chair would end in teaching young men neither how
to speculate, nor how not to speculate, but would simply turn them out
as bad speculators.</p>
<p>I heard of one case in which a father actually carried my idea into
practice.&nbsp; He wanted his son to learn how little confidence was
to be placed in glowing prospectuses and flaming articles, and found
him five hundred pounds which he was to invest according to his lights.&nbsp;
The father expected he would lose the money; but it did not turn out
so in practice, for the boy took so much pains and played so cautiously
that the money kept growing and growing till the father took it away
again, increment and all&mdash;as he was pleased to say, in self defence.</p>
<p>I had made my own mistakes with money about the year 1846, when everyone
else was making them.&nbsp; For a few years I had been so scared and
had suffered so severely, that when (owing to the good advice of the
broker who had advised my father and grandfather before me) I came out
in the end a winner and not a loser, I played no more pranks, but kept
henceforward as nearly in the middle of the middle rut as I could.&nbsp;
I tried in fact to keep my money rather than to make more of it.&nbsp;
I had done with Ernest&rsquo;s money as with my own&mdash;that is to
say I had let it alone after investing it in Midland ordinary stock
according to Miss Pontifex&rsquo;s instructions.&nbsp; No amount of
trouble would have been likely to have increased my godson&rsquo;s estate
one half so much as it had increased without my taking any trouble at
all.</p>
<p>Midland stock at the end of August 1850, when I sold out Miss Pontifex&rsquo;s
debentures, stood at &pound;32 per &pound;100.&nbsp; I invested the
whole of Ernest&rsquo;s &pound;15,000 at this price, and did not change
the investment till a few months before the time of which I have been
writing lately&mdash;that is to say until September 1861.&nbsp; I then
sold at &pound;129 per share and invested in London and North-Western
ordinary stock, which I was advised was more likely to rise than Midlands
now were.&nbsp; I bought the London and North-Western stock at &pound;93
per &pound;100, and my godson now in 1882 still holds it.</p>
<p>The original &pound;15,000 had increased in eleven years to over
&pound;60,000; the accumulated interest, which, of course, I had re-invested,
had come to about &pound;10,000 more, so that Ernest was then worth
over &pound;70,000.&nbsp; At present he is worth nearly double that
sum, and all as the result of leaving well alone.</p>
<p>Large as his property now was, it ought to be increased still further
during the year and a half that remained of his minority, so that on
coming of age he ought to have an income of at least &pound;3500 a year.</p>
<p>I wished him to understand book-keeping by double entry.&nbsp; I
had myself as a young man been compelled to master this not very difficult
art; having acquired it, I have become enamoured of it, and consider
it the most necessary branch of any young man&rsquo;s education after
reading and writing.&nbsp; I was determined, therefore, that Ernest
should master it, and proposed that he should become my steward, book-keeper,
and the manager of my hoardings, for so I called the sum which my ledger
showed to have accumulated from &pound;15,000 to &pound;70,000.&nbsp;
I told him I was going to begin to spend the income as soon as it had
amounted up to &pound;80,000.</p>
<p>A few days after Ernest&rsquo;s discovery that he was still a bachelor,
while he was still at the very beginning of the honeymoon, as it were,
of his renewed unmarried life, I broached my scheme, desired him to
give up his shop, and offered him &pound;300 a year for managing (so
far indeed as it required any managing) his own property.&nbsp; This
&pound;300 a year, I need hardly say, I made him charge to the estate.</p>
<p>If anything had been wanting to complete his happiness it was this.&nbsp;
Here, within three or four days he found himself freed from one of the
most hideous, hopeless <i>liaisons</i> imaginable, and at the same time
raised from a life of almost squalor to the enjoyment of what would
to him be a handsome income.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pound a week,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;for Ellen, and the
rest for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we will charge Ellen&rsquo;s pound
a week to the estate also.&nbsp; You must have a clear &pound;300 for
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I fixed upon this sum, because it was the one which Mr Disraeli gave
Coningsby when Coningsby was at the lowest ebb of his fortunes.&nbsp;
Mr Disraeli evidently thought &pound;300 a year the smallest sum on
which Coningsby could be expected to live, and make the two ends meet;
with this, however, he thought his hero could manage to get along for
a year or two.&nbsp; In 1862, of which I am now writing, prices had
risen, though not so much as they have since done; on the other hand
Ernest had had less expensive antecedents than Coningsby, so on the
whole I thought &pound;300 a year would be about the right thing for
him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXIX</h2>
<p>The question now arose what was to be done with the children.&nbsp;
I explained to Ernest that their expenses must be charged to the estate,
and showed him how small a hole all the various items I proposed to
charge would make in the income at my disposal.&nbsp; He was beginning
to make difficulties, when I quieted him by pointing out that the money
had all come to me from his aunt, over his own head, and reminded him
there had been an understanding between her and me that I should do
much as I was doing, if occasion should arise.</p>
<p>He wanted his children to be brought up in the fresh pure air, and
among other children who were happy and contented; but being still ignorant
of the fortune that awaited him, he insisted that they should pass their
earlier years among the poor rather than the rich.&nbsp; I remonstrated,
but he was very decided about it; and when I reflected that they were
illegitimate, I was not sure but that what Ernest proposed might be
as well for everyone in the end.&nbsp; They were still so young that
it did not much matter where they were, so long as they were with kindly
decent people, and in a healthy neighbourhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be just as unkind to my children,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;as my grandfather was to my father, or my father to me.&nbsp;
If they did not succeed in making their children love them, neither
shall I.&nbsp; I say to myself that I should like to do so, but so did
they.&nbsp; I can make sure that they shall not know how much they would
have hated me if they had had much to do with me, but this is all I
can do.&nbsp; If I must ruin their prospects, let me do so at a reasonable
time before they are old enough to feel it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He mused a little and added with a laugh:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man first quarrels with his father about three-quarters
of a year before he is born.&nbsp; It is then he insists on setting
up a separate establishment; when this has been once agreed to, the
more complete the separation for ever after the better for both.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then he said more seriously: &ldquo;I want to put the children where
they will be well and happy, and where they will not be betrayed into
the misery of false expectations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end he remembered that on his Sunday walks he had more than
once seen a couple who lived on the waterside a few miles below Gravesend,
just where the sea was beginning, and who he thought would do.&nbsp;
They had a family of their own fast coming on and the children seemed
to thrive; both father and mother indeed were comfortable well grown
folks, in whose hands young people would be likely to have as fair a
chance of coming to a good development as in those of any whom he knew.</p>
<p>We went down to see this couple, and as I thought no less well of
them than Ernest did, we offered them a pound a week to take the children
and bring them up as though they were their own.&nbsp; They jumped at
the offer, and in another day or two we brought the children down and
left them, feeling that we had done as well as we could by them, at
any rate for the present.&nbsp; Then Ernest sent his small stock of
goods to Debenham&rsquo;s, gave up the house he had taken two and a
half years previously, and returned to civilisation.</p>
<p>I had expected that he would now rapidly recover, and was disappointed
to see him get as I thought decidedly worse.&nbsp; Indeed, before long
I thought him looking so ill that I insisted on his going with me to
consult one of the most eminent doctors in London.&nbsp; This gentleman
said there was no acute disease but that my young friend was suffering
from nervous prostration, the result of long and severe mental suffering,
from which there was no remedy except time, prosperity and rest.</p>
<p>He said that Ernest must have broken down later on, but that he might
have gone on for some months yet.&nbsp; It was the suddenness of the
relief from tension which had knocked him over now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cross him,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;at once.&nbsp; Crossing
is the great medical discovery of the age.&nbsp; Shake him out of himself
by shaking something else into him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had not told him that money was no object to us and I think he
had reckoned me up as not over rich.&nbsp; He continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing is a mode of touching, touching is a mode of feeding,
feeding is a mode of assimilation, assimilation is a mode of recreation
and reproduction, and this is crossing&mdash;shaking yourself into something
else and something else into you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke laughingly, but it was plain he was serious.&nbsp; He continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are always coming to me who want crossing, or change,
if you prefer it, and who I know have not money enough to let them get
away from London.&nbsp; This has set me thinking how I can best cross
them even if they cannot leave home, and I have made a list of cheap
London amusements which I recommend to my patients; none of them cost
more than a few shillings or take more than half a day or a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I explained that there was no occasion to consider money in this
case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad of it,&rdquo; he said, still laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
homoeopathists use <i>aurum</i> as a medicine, but they do not give
it in large doses enough; if you can dose your young friend with this
pretty freely you will soon bring him round.&nbsp; However, Mr Pontifex
is not well enough to stand so great a change as going abroad yet; from
what you tell me I should think he had had as much change lately as
is good for him.&nbsp; If he were to go abroad now he would probably
be taken seriously ill within a week.&nbsp; We must wait till he has
recovered tone a little more.&nbsp; I will begin by ringing my London
changes on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought a little and then said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have found the Zoological Gardens of service to many of
my patients.&nbsp; I should prescribe for Mr Pontifex a course of the
larger mammals.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let him think he is taking them medicinally,
but let him go to their house twice a week for a fortnight, and stay
with the hippopotamus, the rhinoceros, and the elephants, till they
begin to bore him.&nbsp; I find these beasts do my patients more good
than any others.&nbsp; The monkeys are not a wide enough cross; they
do not stimulate sufficiently.&nbsp; The larger carnivora are unsympathetic.&nbsp;
The reptiles are worse than useless, and the marsupials are not much
better.&nbsp; Birds again, except parrots, are not very beneficial;
he may look at them now and again, but with the elephants and the pig
tribe generally he should mix just now as freely as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, you know, to prevent monotony I should send him, say,
to morning service at the Abbey before he goes.&nbsp; He need not stay
longer than the <i>Te Deum</i>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why, but <i>Jubilates</i>
are seldom satisfactory.&nbsp; Just let him look in at the Abbey, and
sit quietly in Poets&rsquo; Corner till the main part of the music is
over.&nbsp; Let him do this two or three times, not more, before he
goes to the Zoo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then next day send him down to Gravesend by boat.&nbsp; By
all means let him go to the theatres in the evenings&mdash;and then
let him come to me again in a fortnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had the doctor been less eminent in his profession I should have
doubted whether he was in earnest, but I knew him to be a man of business
who would neither waste his own time nor that of his patients.&nbsp;
As soon as we were out of the house we took a cab to Regent&rsquo;s
Park, and spent a couple of hours in sauntering round the different
houses.&nbsp; Perhaps it was on account of what the doctor had told
me, but I certainly became aware of a feeling I had never experienced
before.&nbsp; I mean that I was receiving an influx of new life, or
deriving new ways of looking at life&mdash;which is the same thing&mdash;by
the process.&nbsp; I found the doctor quite right in his estimate of
the larger mammals as the ones which on the whole were most beneficial,
and observed that Ernest, who had heard nothing of what the doctor had
said to me, lingered instinctively in front of them.&nbsp; As for the
elephants, especially the baby elephant, he seemed to be drinking in
large draughts of their lives to the re-creation and regeneration of
his own.</p>
<p>We dined in the gardens, and I noticed with pleasure that Ernest&rsquo;s
appetite was already improved.&nbsp; Since this time, whenever I have
been a little out of sorts myself I have at once gone up to Regent&rsquo;s
Park, and have invariably been benefited.&nbsp; I mention this here
in the hope that some one or other of my readers may find the hint a
useful one.</p>
<p>At the end of his fortnight my hero was much better, more so even
than our friend the doctor had expected.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;Mr Pontifex may go abroad, and the sooner the better.&nbsp;
Let him stay a couple of months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the first Ernest had heard about his going abroad, and he
talked about my not being able to spare him for so long.&nbsp; I soon
made this all right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is now the beginning of April,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;go
down to Marseilles at once, and take steamer to Nice.&nbsp; Then saunter
down the Riviera to Genoa&mdash;from Genoa go to Florence, Rome and
Naples, and come home by way of Venice and the Italian lakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And won&rsquo;t you come too?&rdquo; said he, eagerly.</p>
<p>I said I did not mind if I did, so we began to make our arrangements
next morning, and completed them within a very few days.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXX</h2>
<p>We left by the night mail, crossing from Dover.&nbsp; The night was
soft, and there was a bright moon upon the sea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you love the smell of grease about the engine of a Channel steamer?&nbsp;
Isn&rsquo;t there a lot of hope in it?&rdquo; said Ernest to me, for
he had been to Normandy one summer as a boy with his father and mother,
and the smell carried him back to days before those in which he had
begun to bruise himself against the great outside world.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
always think one of the best parts of going abroad is the first thud
of the piston, and the first gurgling of the water when the paddle begins
to strike it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was very dreamy getting out at Calais, and trudging about with
luggage in a foreign town at an hour when we were generally both of
us in bed and fast asleep, but we settled down to sleep as soon as we
got into the railway carriage, and dozed till we had passed Amiens.&nbsp;
Then waking when the first signs of morning crispness were beginning
to show themselves, I saw that Ernest was already devouring every object
we passed with quick sympathetic curiousness.&nbsp; There was not a
peasant in a blouse driving his cart betimes along the road to market,
not a signalman&rsquo;s wife in her husband&rsquo;s hat and coat waving
a green flag, not a shepherd taking out his sheep to the dewy pastures,
not a bank of opening cowslips as we passed through the railway cuttings,
but he was drinking it all in with an enjoyment too deep for words.&nbsp;
The name of the engine that drew us was Mozart, and Ernest liked this
too.</p>
<p>We reached Paris by six, and had just time to get across the town
and take a morning express train to Marseilles, but before noon my young
friend was tired out and had resigned himself to a series of sleeps
which were seldom intermitted for more than an hour or so together.&nbsp;
He fought against this for a time, but in the end consoled himself by
saying it was so nice to have so much pleasure that he could afford
to throw a lot of it away.&nbsp; Having found a theory on which to justify
himself, he slept in peace.</p>
<p>At Marseilles we rested, and there the excitement of the change proved,
as I had half feared it would, too much for my godson&rsquo;s still
enfeebled state.&nbsp; For a few days he was really ill, but after this
he righted.&nbsp; For my own part I reckon being ill as one of the great
pleasures of life, provided one is not too ill and is not obliged to
work till one is better.&nbsp; I remember being ill once in a foreign
hotel myself and how much I enjoyed it.&nbsp; To lie there careless
of everything, quiet and warm, and with no weight upon the mind, to
hear the clinking of the plates in the far-off kitchen as the scullion
rinsed them and put them by; to watch the soft shadows come and go upon
the ceiling as the sun came out or went behind a cloud; to listen to
the pleasant murmuring of the fountain in the court below, and the shaking
of the bells on the horses&rsquo; collars and the clink of their hoofs
upon the ground as the flies plagued them; not only to be a lotus-eater
but to know that it was one&rsquo;s duty to be a lotus-eater.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I thought to myself, &ldquo;if I could only now, having
so forgotten care, drop off to sleep for ever, would not this be a better
piece of fortune than any I can ever hope for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course it would, but we would not take it though it were offered
us.&nbsp; No matter what evil may befall us, we will mostly abide by
it and see it out.</p>
<p>I could see that Ernest felt much as I had felt myself.&nbsp; He
said little, but noted everything.&nbsp; Once only did he frighten me.&nbsp;
He called me to his bedside just as it was getting dusk and said in
a grave, quiet manner that he should like to speak to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I may perhaps
never recover from this illness, and in case I do not I should like
you to know that there is only one thing which weighs upon me.&nbsp;
I refer,&rdquo; he continued after a slight pause, &ldquo;to my conduct
towards my father and mother.&nbsp; I have been much too good to them.&nbsp;
I treated them much too considerately,&rdquo; on which he broke into
a smile which assured me that there was nothing seriously amiss with
him.</p>
<p>On the walls of his bedroom were a series of French Revolution prints
representing events in the life of Lycurgus.&nbsp; There was &ldquo;Grandeur
d&rsquo;&acirc;me de Lycurgue,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lycurgue consulte l&rsquo;oracle,&rdquo;
and then there was &ldquo;Calciope &agrave; la Cour.&rdquo;&nbsp; Under
this was written in French and Spanish: &ldquo;Mod&egrave;le de gr&acirc;ce
et de beaut&eacute;, la jeune Calciope non moins sage que belle avait
m&eacute;rit&eacute; l&rsquo;estime et l&rsquo;attachement du vertueux
Lycurgue.&nbsp; Vivement &eacute;pris de tant de charmes, l&rsquo;illustre
philosophe la conduisait dans le temple de Junon, o&ugrave; ils s&rsquo;unirent
par un serment sacr&eacute;.&nbsp; Apr&egrave;s cette auguste c&eacute;r&eacute;monie,
Lycurgue s&rsquo;empressa de conduire sa jeune &eacute;pouse au palais
de son fr&egrave;re Polydecte, Roi de Lac&eacute;d&eacute;mon.&nbsp;
Seigneur, lui dit-il, la vertueuse Calciope vient de recevoir mes voeux
aux pieds des autels, j&rsquo;ose vous prier d&rsquo;approuver cette
union.&nbsp; Le Roi t&eacute;moigna d&rsquo;abord quelque surprise,
mais l&rsquo;estime qu&rsquo;il avait pour son fr&egrave;re lui inspira
une r&eacute;ponse pleine de beinveillance.&nbsp; Il s&rsquo;approcha
aussit&ocirc;t de Calciope qu&rsquo;il embrassa tendrement, combla ensuite
Lycurgue de pr&eacute;venances et parut tr&egrave;s satisfait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He called my attention to this and then said somewhat timidly that
he would rather have married Ellen than Calciope.&nbsp; I saw he was
hardening and made no hesitation about proposing that in another day
or two we should proceed upon our journey.</p>
<p>I will not weary the reader by taking him with us over beaten ground.&nbsp;
We stopped at Siena, Cortona, Orvieto, Perugia and many other cities,
and then after a fortnight passed between Rome and Naples went to the
Venetian provinces and visited all those wondrous towns that lie between
the southern slopes of the Alps and the northern ones of the Apennines,
coming back at last by the S. Gothard.&nbsp; I doubt whether he had
enjoyed the trip more than I did myself, but it was not till we were
on the point of returning that Ernest had recovered strength enough
to be called fairly well, and it was not for many months that he so
completely lost all sense of the wounds which the last four years had
inflicted on him as to feel as though there were a scar and a scar only
remaining.</p>
<p>They say that when people have lost an arm or a foot they feel pains
in it now and again for a long while after they have lost it.&nbsp;
One pain which he had almost forgotten came upon him on his return to
England, I mean the sting of his having been imprisoned.&nbsp; As long
as he was only a small shop-keeper his imprisonment mattered nothing;
nobody knew of it, and if they had known they would not have cared;
now, however, though he was returning to his old position he was returning
to it disgraced, and the pain from which he had been saved in the first
instance by surroundings so new that he had hardly recognised his own
identity in the middle of them, came on him as from a wound inflicted
yesterday.</p>
<p>He thought of the high resolves which he had made in prison about
using his disgrace as a vantage ground of strength rather than trying
to make people forget it.&nbsp; &ldquo;That was all very well then,&rdquo;
he thought to himself, &ldquo;when the grapes were beyond my reach,
but now it is different.&rdquo;&nbsp; Besides, who but a prig would
set himself high aims, or make high resolves at all?</p>
<p>Some of his old friends, on learning that he had got rid of his supposed
wife and was now comfortably off again, wanted to renew their acquaintance;
he was grateful to them and sometimes tried to meet their advances half
way, but it did not do, and ere long he shrank back into himself, pretending
not to know them.&nbsp; An infernal demon of honesty haunted him which
made him say to himself: &ldquo;These men know a great deal, but do
not know all&mdash;if they did they would cut me&mdash;and therefore
I have no right to their acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought that everyone except himself was <i>sans peur et sans
reproche</i>.&nbsp; Of course they must be, for if they had not been,
would they not have been bound to warn all who had anything to do with
them of their deficiencies?&nbsp; Well, he could not do this, and he
would not have people&rsquo;s acquaintance under false pretences, so
he gave up even hankering after rehabilitation and fell back upon his
old tastes for music and literature.</p>
<p>Of course he has long since found out how silly all this was, how
silly I mean in theory, for in practice it worked better than it ought
to have done, by keeping him free from <i>liaisons</i> which would have
tied his tongue and made him see success elsewhere than where he came
in time to see it.&nbsp; He did what he did instinctively and for no
other reason than because it was most natural to him.&nbsp; So far as
he thought at all, he thought wrong, but what he did was right.&nbsp;
I said something of this kind to him once not so very long ago, and
told him he had always aimed high.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never aimed at all,&rdquo;
he replied a little indignantly, &ldquo;and you may be sure I should
have aimed low enough if I had thought I had got the chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I suppose after all that no one whose mind was not, to put it mildly,
abnormal, ever yet aimed very high out of pure malice aforethought.&nbsp;
I once saw a fly alight on a cup of hot coffee on which the milk had
formed a thin skin; he perceived his extreme danger, and I noted with
what ample strides and almost supermuscan effort he struck across the
treacherous surface and made for the edge of the cup&mdash;for the ground
was not solid enough to let him raise himself from it by his wings.&nbsp;
As I watched him I fancied that so supreme a moment of difficulty and
danger might leave him with an increase of moral and physical power
which might even descend in some measure to his offspring.&nbsp; But
surely he would not have got the increased moral power if he could have
helped it, and he will not knowingly alight upon another cup of hot
coffee.&nbsp; The more I see the more sure I am that it does not matter
why people do the right thing so long only as they do it, nor why they
may have done the wrong if they have done it.&nbsp; The result depends
upon the thing done and the motive goes for nothing.&nbsp; I have read
somewhere, but cannot remember where, that in some country district
there was once a great scarcity of food, during which the poor suffered
acutely; many indeed actually died of starvation, and all were hard
put to it.&nbsp; In one village, however, there was a poor widow with
a family of young children, who, though she had small visible means
of subsistence, still looked well-fed and comfortable, as also did all
her little ones.&nbsp; &ldquo;How,&rdquo; everyone asked, &ldquo;did
they manage to live?&rdquo;&nbsp; It was plain they had a secret, and
it was equally plain that it could be no good one; for there came a
hurried, hunted look over the poor woman&rsquo;s face if anyone alluded
to the way in which she and hers throve when others starved; the family,
moreover, were sometimes seen out at unusual hours of the night, and
evidently brought things home, which could hardly have been honestly
come by.&nbsp; They knew they were under suspicion, and, being hitherto
of excellent name, it made them very unhappy, for it must be confessed
that they believed what they did to be uncanny if not absolutely wicked;
nevertheless, in spite of this they throve, and kept their strength
when all their neighbours were pinched.</p>
<p>At length matters came to a head and the clergyman of the parish
cross-questioned the poor woman so closely that with many tears and
a bitter sense of degradation she confessed the truth; she and her children
went into the hedges and gathered snails, which they made into broth
and ate&mdash;could she ever be forgiven?&nbsp; Was there any hope of
salvation for her either in this world or the next after such unnatural
conduct?</p>
<p>So again I have heard of an old dowager countess whose money was
all in Consols; she had had many sons, and in her anxiety to give the
younger ones a good start, wanted a larger income than Consols would
give her.&nbsp; She consulted her solicitor and was advised to sell
her Consols and invest in the London and North-Western Railway, then
at about 85.&nbsp; This was to her what eating snails was to the poor
widow whose story I have told above.&nbsp; With shame and grief, as
of one doing an unclean thing&mdash;but her boys must have their start&mdash;she
did as she was advised.&nbsp; Then for a long while she could not sleep
at night and was haunted by a presage of disaster.&nbsp; Yet what happened?&nbsp;
She started her boys, and in a few years found her capital doubled into
the bargain, on which she sold out and went back again to Consols and
died in the full blessedness of fund-holding.</p>
<p>She thought, indeed, that she was doing a wrong and dangerous thing,
but this had absolutely nothing to do with it.&nbsp; Suppose she had
invested in the full confidence of a recommendation by some eminent
London banker whose advice was bad, and so had lost all her money, and
suppose she had done this with a light heart and with no conviction
of sin&mdash;would her innocence of evil purpose and the excellence
of her motive have stood her in any stead?&nbsp; Not they.</p>
<p>But to return to my story.&nbsp; Towneley gave my hero most trouble.&nbsp;
Towneley, as I have said, knew that Ernest would have money soon, but
Ernest did not of course know that he knew it.&nbsp; Towneley was rich
himself, and was married now; Ernest would be rich soon, had <i>bona
fide</i> intended to be married already, and would doubtless marry a
lawful wife later on.&nbsp; Such a man was worth taking pains with,
and when Towneley one day met Ernest in the street, and Ernest tried
to avoid him, Towneley would not have it, but with his usual quick good
nature read his thoughts, caught him, morally speaking, by the scruff
of his neck, and turned him laughingly inside out, telling him he would
have no such nonsense.</p>
<p>Towneley was just as much Ernest&rsquo;s idol now as he had ever
been, and Ernest, who was very easily touched, felt more gratefully
and warmly than ever towards him, but there was an unconscious something
which was stronger than Towneley, and made my hero determine to break
with him more determinedly perhaps than with any other living person;
he thanked him in a low hurried voice and pressed his hand, while tears
came into his eyes in spite of all his efforts to repress them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If we meet again,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do not look at me, but
if hereafter you hear of me writing things you do not like, think of
me as charitably as you can,&rdquo; and so they parted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Towneley is a good fellow,&rdquo; said I, gravely, &ldquo;and
you should not have cut him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Towneley,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;is not only a good fellow,
but he is without exception the very best man I ever saw in my life&mdash;except,&rdquo;
he paid me the compliment of saying, &ldquo;yourself; Towneley is my
notion of everything which I should most like to be&mdash;but there
is no real solidarity between us.&nbsp; I should be in perpetual fear
of losing his good opinion if I said things he did not like, and I mean
to say a great many things,&rdquo; he continued more merrily, &ldquo;which
Towneley will not like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man, as I have said already, can give up father and mother for
Christ&rsquo;s sake tolerably easily for the most part, but it is not
so easy to give up people like Towneley.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXXI</h2>
<p>So he fell away from all old friends except myself and three or four
old intimates of my own, who were as sure to take to him as he to them,
and who like myself enjoyed getting hold of a young fresh mind.&nbsp;
Ernest attended to the keeping of my account books whenever there was
anything which could possibly be attended to, which there seldom was,
and spent the greater part of the rest of his time in adding to the
many notes and tentative essays which had already accumulated in his
portfolios.&nbsp; Anyone who was used to writing could see at a glance
that literature was his natural development, and I was pleased at seeing
him settle down to it so spontaneously.&nbsp; I was less pleased, however,
to observe that he would still occupy himself with none but the most
serious, I had almost said solemn, subjects, just as he never cared
about any but the most serious kind of music.</p>
<p>I said to him one day that the very slender reward which God had
attached to the pursuit of serious inquiry was a sufficient proof that
He disapproved of it, or at any rate that He did not set much store
by it nor wish to encourage it.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t talk about rewards.&nbsp; Look at
Milton, who only got &pound;5 for &lsquo;Paradise Lost.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a great deal too much,&rdquo; I rejoined promptly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I would have given him twice as much myself not to have written
it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest was a little shocked.&nbsp; &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; he
said laughingly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t write poetry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a cut at me, for my burlesques were, of course, written
in rhyme.&nbsp; So I dropped the matter.</p>
<p>After a time he took it into his head to reopen the question of his
getting &pound;300 a year for doing, as he said, absolutely nothing,
and said he would try to find some employment which should bring him
in enough to live upon.</p>
<p>I laughed at this but let him alone.&nbsp; He tried and tried very
hard for a long while, but I need hardly say was unsuccessful.&nbsp;
The older I grow, the more convinced I become of the folly and credulity
of the public; but at the same time the harder do I see it is to impose
oneself upon that folly and credulity.</p>
<p>He tried editor after editor with article after article.&nbsp; Sometimes
an editor listened to him and told him to leave his articles; he almost
invariably, however, had them returned to him in the end with a polite
note saying that they were not suited for the particular paper to which
he had sent them.&nbsp; And yet many of these very articles appeared
in his later works, and no one complained of them, not at least on the
score of bad literary workmanship.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said
to me one day, &ldquo;that demand is very imperious, and supply must
be very suppliant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once, indeed, the editor of an important monthly magazine accepted
an article from him, and he thought he had now got a footing in the
literary world.&nbsp; The article was to appear in the next issue but
one, and he was to receive proof from the printers in about ten days
or a fortnight; but week after week passed and there was no proof; month
after month went by and there was still no room for Ernest&rsquo;s article;
at length after about six months the editor one morning told him that
he had filled every number of his review for the next ten months, but
that his article should definitely appear.&nbsp; On this he insisted
on having his MS. returned to him.</p>
<p>Sometimes his articles were actually published, and he found the
editor had edited them according to his own fancy, putting in jokes
which he thought were funny, or cutting out the very passage which Ernest
had considered the point of the whole thing, and then, though the articles
appeared, when it came to paying for them it was another matter, and
he never saw his money.&nbsp; &ldquo;Editors,&rdquo; he said to me one
day about this time, &ldquo;are like the people who bought and sold
in the book of Revelation; there is not one but has the mark of the
beast upon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last after months of disappointment and many a tedious hour wasted
in dingy anterooms (and of all anterooms those of editors appear to
me to be the dreariest), he got a <i>bona fide</i> offer of employment
from one of the first class weekly papers through an introduction I
was able to get for him from one who had powerful influence with the
paper in question.&nbsp; The editor sent him a dozen long books upon
varied and difficult subjects, and told him to review them in a single
article within a week.&nbsp; In one book there was an editorial note
to the effect that the writer was to be condemned.&nbsp; Ernest particularly
admired the book he was desired to condemn, and feeling how hopeless
it was for him to do anything like justice to the books submitted to
him, returned them to the editor.</p>
<p>At last one paper did actually take a dozen or so of articles from
him, and gave him cash down a couple of guineas apiece for them, but
having done this it expired within a fortnight after the last of Ernest&rsquo;s
articles had appeared.&nbsp; It certainly looked very much as if the
other editors knew their business in declining to have anything to do
with my unlucky godson.</p>
<p>I was not sorry that he failed with periodical literature, for writing
for reviews or newspapers is bad training for one who may aspire to
write works of more permanent interest.&nbsp; A young writer should
have more time for reflection than he can get as a contributor to the
daily or even weekly press.&nbsp; Ernest himself, however, was chagrined
at finding how unmarketable he was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said
to me, &ldquo;If I was a well-bred horse, or sheep, or a pure-bred pigeon
or lop-eared rabbit I should be more saleable.&nbsp; If I was even a
cathedral in a colonial town people would give me something, but as
it is they do not want me&rdquo;; and now that he was well and rested
he wanted to set up a shop again, but this, of course, I would not hear
of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What care I,&rdquo; said he to me one day, &ldquo;about being
what they call a gentleman?&rdquo;&nbsp; And his manner was almost fierce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has being a gentleman ever done for me except make me
less able to prey and more easy to be preyed upon?&nbsp; It has changed
the manner of my being swindled, that is all.&nbsp; But for your kindness
to me I should be penniless.&nbsp; Thank heaven I have placed my children
where I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I begged him to keep quiet a little longer and not talk about taking
a shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will being a gentleman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;bring me money
at the last, and will anything bring me as much peace at the last as
money will?&nbsp; They say that those who have riches enter hardly into
the kingdom of Heaven.&nbsp; By Jove, they do; they are like Struldbrugs;
they live and live and live and are happy for many a long year after
they would have entered into the kingdom of Heaven if they had been
poor.&nbsp; I want to live long and to raise my children, if I see they
would be happier for the raising; that is what I want, and it is not
what I am doing now that will help me.&nbsp; Being a gentleman is a
luxury which I cannot afford, therefore I do not want it.&nbsp; Let
me go back to my shop again, and do things for people which they want
done and will pay me for doing for them.&nbsp; They know what they want
and what is good for them better than I can tell them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was hard to deny the soundness of this, and if he had been dependent
only on the &pound;300 a year which he was getting from me I should
have advised him to open his shop again next morning.&nbsp; As it was,
I temporised and raised obstacles, and quieted him from time to time
as best I could.</p>
<p>Of course he read Mr Darwin&rsquo;s books as fast as they came out
and adopted evolution as an article of faith.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems
to me,&rdquo; he said once, &ldquo;that I am like one of those caterpillars
which, if they have been interrupted in making their hammock, must begin
again from the beginning.&nbsp; So long as I went back a long way down
in the social scale I got on all right, and should have made money but
for Ellen; when I try to take up the work at a higher stage I fail completely.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I do not know whether the analogy holds good or not, but I am sure Ernest&rsquo;s
instinct was right in telling him that after a heavy fall he had better
begin life again at a very low stage, and as I have just said, I would
have let him go back to his shop if I had not known what I did.</p>
<p>As the time fixed upon by his aunt drew nearer I prepared him more
and more for what was coming, and at last, on his twenty-eighth birthday,
I was able to tell him all and to show him the letter signed by his
aunt upon her death-bed to the effect that I was to hold the money in
trust for him.&nbsp; His birthday happened that year (1863) to be on
a Sunday, but on the following day I transferred his shares into his
own name, and presented him with the account books which he had been
keeping for the last year and a half.</p>
<p>In spite of all that I had done to prepare him, it was a long while
before I could get him actually to believe that the money was his own.&nbsp;
He did not say much&mdash;no more did I, for I am not sure that I did
not feel as much moved at having brought my long trusteeship to a satisfactory
conclusion as Ernest did at finding himself owner of more than &pound;70,000.&nbsp;
When he did speak it was to jerk out a sentence or two of reflection
at a time.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I were rendering this moment in music,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;I should allow myself free use of the augmented sixth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A little later I remember his saying with a laugh that had something
of a family likeness to his aunt&rsquo;s: &ldquo;It is not the pleasure
it causes me which I enjoy so, it is the pain it will cause to all my
friends except yourself and Towneley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;You cannot tell your father and mother&mdash;it would
drive them mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it would be too cruel;
it would be like Isaac offering up Abraham and no thicket with a ram
in it near at hand.&nbsp; Besides why should I?&nbsp; We have cut each
other these four years.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXXII</h2>
<p>It almost seemed as though our casual mention of Theobald and Christina
had in some way excited them from a dormant to an active state.&nbsp;
During the years that had elapsed since they last appeared upon the
scene they had remained at Battersby, and had concentrated their affection
upon their other children.</p>
<p>It had been a bitter pill to Theobald to lose his power of plaguing
his first-born; if the truth were known I believe he had felt this more
acutely than any disgrace which might have been shed upon him by Ernest&rsquo;s
imprisonment.&nbsp; He had made one or two attempts to reopen negotiations
through me, but I never said anything about them to Ernest, for I knew
it would upset him.&nbsp; I wrote, however, to Theobald that I had found
his son inexorable, and recommended him for the present, at any rate,
to desist from returning to the subject.&nbsp; This I thought would
be at once what Ernest would like best and Theobald least.</p>
<p>A few days, however, after Ernest had come into his property, I received
a letter from Theobald enclosing one for Ernest which I could not withhold.</p>
<p>The letter ran thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To my son Ernest,&mdash;Although you have more
than once rejected my overtures I appeal yet again to your better nature.&nbsp;
Your mother, who has long been ailing, is, I believe, near her end;
she is unable to keep anything on her stomach, and Dr Martin holds out
but little hopes of her recovery.&nbsp; She has expressed a wish to
see you, and says she knows you will not refuse to come to her, which,
considering her condition, I am unwilling to suppose you will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remit you a Post Office order for your fare, and will pay
your return journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want clothes to come in, order what you consider suitable,
and desire that the bill be sent to me; I will pay it immediately, to
an amount not exceeding eight or nine pounds, and if you will let me
know what train you will come by, I will send the carriage to meet you.&nbsp;
Believe me, Your affectionate father, T. PONTIFEX.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course there could be no hesitation on Ernest&rsquo;s part.&nbsp;
He could afford to smile now at his father&rsquo;s offering to pay for
his clothes, and his sending him a Post Office order for the exact price
of a second-class ticket, and he was of course shocked at learning the
state his mother was said to be in, and touched at her desire to see
him.&nbsp; He telegraphed that he would come down at once.&nbsp; I saw
him a little before he started, and was pleased to see how well his
tailor had done by him.&nbsp; Towneley himself could not have been appointed
more becomingly.&nbsp; His portmanteau, his railway wrapper, everything
he had about him, was in keeping.&nbsp; I thought he had grown much
better-looking than he had been at two or three and twenty.&nbsp; His
year and a half of peace had effaced all the ill effects of his previous
suffering, and now that he had become actually rich there was an air
of <i>insouciance</i> and good humour upon his face, as of a man with
whom everything was going perfectly right, which would have made a much
plainer man good-looking.&nbsp; I was proud of him and delighted with
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;that whatever
else he may do, he will never marry again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The journey was a painful one.&nbsp; As he drew near to the station
and caught sight of each familiar feature, so strong was the force of
association that he felt as though his coming into his aunt&rsquo;s
money had been a dream, and he were again returning to his father&rsquo;s
house as he had returned to it from Cambridge for the vacations.&nbsp;
Do what he would, the old dull weight of <i>home-sickness</i> began
to oppress him, his heart beat fast as he thought of his approaching
meeting with his father and mother, &ldquo;and I shall have,&rdquo;
he said to himself, &ldquo;to kiss Charlotte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would his father meet him at the station?&nbsp; Would he greet him
as though nothing had happened, or would he be cold and distant?&nbsp;
How, again, would he take the news of his son&rsquo;s good fortune?&nbsp;
As the train drew up to the platform, Ernest&rsquo;s eye ran hurriedly
over the few people who were in the station.&nbsp; His father&rsquo;s
well-known form was not among them, but on the other side of the palings
which divided the station yard from the platform, he saw the pony carriage,
looking, as he thought, rather shabby, and recognised his father&rsquo;s
coachman.&nbsp; In a few minutes more he was in the carriage driving
towards Battersby.&nbsp; He could not help smiling as he saw the coachman
give a look of surprise at finding him so much changed in personal appearance.&nbsp;
The coachman was the more surprised because when Ernest had last been
at home he had been dressed as a clergyman, and now he was not only
a layman, but a layman who was got up regardless of expense.&nbsp; The
change was so great that it was not till Ernest actually spoke to him
that the coachman knew him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are my father and mother?&rdquo; he asked hurriedly, as
he got into the carriage.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Master&rsquo;s well, sir,&rdquo;
was the answer, &ldquo;but the Missis is very sadly.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
horse knew that he was going home and pulled hard at the reins.&nbsp;
The weather was cold and raw&mdash;the very ideal of a November day;
in one part of the road the floods were out, and near here they had
to pass through a number of horsemen and dogs, for the hounds had met
that morning at a place near Battersby.&nbsp; Ernest saw several people
whom he knew, but they either, as is most likely, did not recognise
him, or did not know of his good luck.&nbsp; When Battersby church tower
drew near, and he saw the Rectory on the top of the hill, its chimneys
just showing above the leafless trees with which it was surrounded,
he threw himself back in the carriage and covered his face with his
hands.</p>
<p>It came to an end, as even the worst quarters of an hour do, and
in a few minutes more he was on the steps in front of his father&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; His father, hearing the carriage arrive, came a little
way down the steps to meet him.&nbsp; Like the coachman he saw at a
glance that Ernest was appointed as though money were abundant with
him, and that he was looking robust and full of health and vigour.</p>
<p>This was not what he had bargained for.&nbsp; He wanted Ernest to
return, but he was to return as any respectable, well-regulated prodigal
ought to return&mdash;abject, broken-hearted, asking forgiveness from
the tenderest and most long-suffering father in the whole world.&nbsp;
If he should have shoes and stockings and whole clothes at all, it should
be only because absolute rags and tatters had been graciously dispensed
with, whereas here he was swaggering in a grey ulster and a blue and
white necktie, and looking better than Theobald had ever seen him in
his life.&nbsp; It was unprincipled.&nbsp; Was it for this that he had
been generous enough to offer to provide Ernest with decent clothes
in which to come and visit his mother&rsquo;s death-bed?&nbsp; Could
any advantage be meaner than the one which Ernest had taken?&nbsp; Well,
he would not go a penny beyond the eight or nine pounds which he had
promised.&nbsp; It was fortunate he had given a limit.&nbsp; Why he,
Theobald, had never been able to afford such a portmanteau in his life.&nbsp;
He was still using an old one which his father had turned over to him
when he went up to Cambridge.&nbsp; Besides, he had said clothes, not
a portmanteau.</p>
<p>Ernest saw what was passing through his father&rsquo;s mind, and
felt that he ought to have prepared him in some way for what he now
saw; but he had sent his telegram so immediately on receiving his father&rsquo;s
letter, and had followed it so promptly that it would not have been
easy to do so even if he had thought of it.&nbsp; He put out his hand
and said laughingly, &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all paid for&mdash;I am afraid
you do not know that Mr Overton has handed over to me Aunt Alethea&rsquo;s
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Theobald flushed scarlet.&nbsp; &ldquo;But why,&rdquo; he said, and
these were the first words that actually crossed his lips&mdash;&ldquo;if
the money was not his to keep, did he not hand it over to my brother
John and me?&rdquo;&nbsp; He stammered a good deal and looked sheepish,
but he got the words out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, my dear father,&rdquo; said Ernest still laughing,
&ldquo;my aunt left it to him in trust for me, not in trust either for
you or for my Uncle John&mdash;and it has accumulated till it is now
over &pound;70,000.&nbsp; But tell me how is my mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Ernest,&rdquo; said Theobald excitedly, &ldquo;the matter
cannot rest here, I must know that this is all open and above board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This had the true Theobald ring and instantly brought the whole train
of ideas which in Ernest&rsquo;s mind were connected with his father.&nbsp;
The surroundings were the old familiar ones, but the surrounded were
changed almost beyond power of recognition.&nbsp; He turned sharply
on Theobald in a moment.&nbsp; I will not repeat the words he used,
for they came out before he had time to consider them, and they might
strike some of my readers as disrespectful; there were not many of them,
but they were effectual.&nbsp; Theobald said nothing, but turned almost
of an ashen colour; he never again spoke to his son in such a way as
to make it necessary for him to repeat what he had said on this occasion.&nbsp;
Ernest quickly recovered his temper and again asked after his mother.&nbsp;
Theobald was glad enough to take this opening now, and replied at once
in the tone he would have assumed towards one he most particularly desired
to conciliate, that she was getting rapidly worse in spite of all he
had been able to do for her, and concluded by saying she had been the
comfort and mainstay of his life for more than thirty years, but that
he could not wish it prolonged.</p>
<p>The pair then went upstairs to Christina&rsquo;s room, the one in
which Ernest had been born.&nbsp; His father went before him and prepared
her for her son&rsquo;s approach.&nbsp; The poor woman raised herself
in bed as he came towards her, and weeping as she flung her arms around
him, cried: &ldquo;Oh, I knew he would come, I knew, I knew he could
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest broke down and wept as he had not done for years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my boy, my boy,&rdquo; she said as soon as she could recover
her voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you never really been near us for all these
years?&nbsp; Ah, you do not know how we have loved you and mourned over
you, papa just as much as I have.&nbsp; You know he shows his feelings
less, but I can never tell you how very, very deeply he has felt for
you.&nbsp; Sometimes at night I have thought I have heard footsteps
in the garden, and have got quietly out of bed lest I should wake him,
and gone to the window to look out, but there has been only dark or
the greyness of the morning, and I have gone crying back to bed again.&nbsp;
Still I think you have been near us though you were too proud to let
us know&mdash;and now at last I have you in my arms once more, my dearest,
dearest boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How cruel, how infamously unfeeling Ernest thought he had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;forgive me&mdash;the fault
was mine, I ought not to have been so hard; I was wrong, very wrong&rdquo;;
the poor blubbering fellow meant what he said, and his heart yearned
to his mother as he had never thought that it could yearn again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But have you never,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;come although
it was in the dark and we did not know it&mdash;oh, let me think that
you have not been so cruel as we have thought you.&nbsp; Tell me that
you came if only to comfort me and make me happier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest was ready.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had no money to come with, mother,
till just lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was an excuse Christina could understand and make allowance
for; &ldquo;Oh, then you would have come, and I will take the will for
the deed&mdash;and now that I have you safe again, say that you will
never, never leave me&mdash;not till&mdash;not till&mdash;oh, my boy,
have they told you I am dying?&rdquo;&nbsp; She wept bitterly, and buried
her head in her pillow.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXXIII</h2>
<p>Joey and Charlotte were in the room.&nbsp; Joey was now ordained,
and was curate to Theobald.&nbsp; He and Ernest had never been sympathetic,
and Ernest saw at a glance that there was no chance of a <i>rapprochement</i>
between them.&nbsp; He was a little startled at seeing Joey dressed
as a clergyman, and looking so like what he had looked himself a few
years earlier, for there was a good deal of family likeness between
the pair; but Joey&rsquo;s face was cold and was illumined with no spark
of Bohemianism; he was a clergyman and was going to do as other clergymen
did, neither better nor worse.&nbsp; He greeted Ernest rather <i>de
haut en bas</i>, that is to say he began by trying to do so, but the
affair tailed off unsatisfactorily.</p>
<p>His sister presented her cheek to him to be kissed.&nbsp; How he
hated it; he had been dreading it for the last three hours.&nbsp; She,
too, was distant and reproachful in her manner, as such a superior person
was sure to be.&nbsp; She had a grievance against him inasmuch as she
was still unmarried.&nbsp; She laid the blame of this at Ernest&rsquo;s
door; it was his misconduct she maintained in secret, which had prevented
young men from making offers to her, and she ran him up a heavy bill
for consequential damages.&nbsp; She and Joey had from the first developed
an instinct for hunting with the hounds, and now these two had fairly
identified themselves with the older generation&mdash;that is to say
as against Ernest.&nbsp; On this head there was an offensive and defensive
alliance between them, but between themselves there was subdued but
internecine warfare.</p>
<p>This at least was what Ernest gathered, partly from his recollections
of the parties concerned, and partly from his observation of their little
ways during the first half-hour after his arrival, while they were all
together in his mother&rsquo;s bedroom&mdash;for as yet of course they
did not know that he had money.&nbsp; He could see that they eyed him
from time to time with a surprise not unmixed with indignation, and
knew very well what they were thinking.</p>
<p>Christina saw the change which had come over him&mdash;how much firmer
and more vigorous both in mind and body he seemed than when she had
last seen him.&nbsp; She saw too how well he was dressed, and, like
the others, in spite of the return of all her affection for her first-born,
was a little alarmed about Theobald&rsquo;s pocket, which she supposed
would have to be mulcted for all this magnificence.&nbsp; Perceiving
this, Ernest relieved her mind and told her all about his aunt&rsquo;s
bequest, and how I had husbanded it, in the presence of his brother
and sister&mdash;who, however, pretended not to notice, or at any rate
to notice as a matter in which they could hardly be expected to take
an interest.</p>
<p>His mother kicked a little at first against the money&rsquo;s having
gone to him as she said &ldquo;over his papa&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, my dear,&rdquo; she said in a deprecating tone, &ldquo;this
is more than ever your papa has had&rdquo;; but Ernest calmed her by
suggesting that if Miss Pontifex had known how large the sum would become
she would have left the greater part of it to Theobald.&nbsp; This compromise
was accepted by Christina who forthwith, ill as she was, entered with
ardour into the new position, and taking it as a fresh point of departure,
began spending Ernest&rsquo;s money for him.</p>
<p>I may say in passing that Christina was right in saying that Theobald
had never had so much money as his son was now possessed of.&nbsp; In
the first place he had not had a fourteen years&rsquo; minority with
no outgoings to prevent the accumulation of the money, and in the second
he, like myself and almost everyone else, had suffered somewhat in the
1846 times&mdash;not enough to cripple him or even seriously to hurt
him, but enough to give him a scare and make him stick to debentures
for the rest of his life.&nbsp; It was the fact of his son&rsquo;s being
the richer man of the two, and of his being rich so young, which rankled
with Theobald even more than the fact of his having money at all.&nbsp;
If he had had to wait till he was sixty or sixty-five, and become broken
down from long failure in the meantime, why then perhaps he might have
been allowed to have whatever sum should suffice to keep him out of
the workhouse and pay his death-bed expenses; but that he should come
in to &pound;70,000 at eight and twenty, and have no wife and only two
children&mdash;it was intolerable.&nbsp; Christina was too ill and in
too great a hurry to spend the money to care much about such details
as the foregoing, and she was naturally much more good-natured than
Theobald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This piece of good fortune&rdquo;&mdash;she saw it at a glance&mdash;&ldquo;quite
wiped out the disgrace of his having been imprisoned.&nbsp; There should
be no more nonsense about that.&nbsp; The whole thing was a mistake,
an unfortunate mistake, true, but the less said about it now the better.&nbsp;
Of course Ernest would come back and live at Battersby until he was
married, and he would pay his father handsomely for board and lodging.&nbsp;
In fact it would be only right that Theobald should make a profit, nor
would Ernest himself wish it to be other than a handsome one; this was
far the best and simplest arrangement; and he could take his sister
out more than Theobald or Joey cared to do, and would also doubtless
entertain very handsomely at Battersby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he would buy Joey a living, and make large presents
yearly to his sister&mdash;was there anything else?&nbsp; Oh! yes&mdash;he
would become a county magnate now; a man with nearly &pound;4000 a year
should certainly become a county magnate.&nbsp; He might even go into
Parliament.&nbsp; He had very fair abilities, nothing indeed approaching
such genius as Dr Skinner&rsquo;s, nor even as Theobald&rsquo;s, still
he was not deficient and if he got into Parliament&mdash;so young too&mdash;there
was nothing to hinder his being Prime Minister before he died, and if
so, of course, he would become a peer.&nbsp; Oh! why did he not set
about it all at once, so that she might live to hear people call her
son &lsquo;my lord&rsquo;&mdash;Lord Battersby she thought would do
very nicely, and if she was well enough to sit he must certainly have
her portrait painted at full length for one end of his large dining-hall.&nbsp;
It should be exhibited at the Royal Academy: &lsquo;Portrait of Lord
Battersby&rsquo;s mother,&rsquo; she said to herself, and her heart
fluttered with all its wonted vivacity.&nbsp; If she could not sit,
happily, she had been photographed not so very long ago, and the portrait
had been as successful as any photograph could be of a face which depended
so entirely upon its expression as her own.&nbsp; Perhaps the painter
could take the portrait sufficiently from this.&nbsp; It was better
after all that Ernest had given up the Church&mdash;how far more wisely
God arranges matters for us than ever we can do for ourselves!&nbsp;
She saw it all now&mdash;it was Joey who would become Archbishop of
Canterbury and Ernest would remain a layman and become Prime Minister&rdquo;
. . . and so on till her daughter told her it was time to take her medicine.</p>
<p>I suppose this reverie, which is a mere fragment of what actually
ran through Christina&rsquo;s brain, occupied about a minute and a half,
but it, or the presence of her son, seemed to revive her spirits wonderfully.&nbsp;
Ill, dying indeed, and suffering as she was, she brightened up so as
to laugh once or twice quite merrily during the course of the afternoon.&nbsp;
Next day Dr Martin said she was so much better that he almost began
to have hopes of her recovery again.&nbsp; Theobald, whenever this was
touched upon as possible, would shake his head and say: &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t
wish it prolonged,&rdquo; and then Charlotte caught Ernest unawares
and said: &ldquo;You know, dear Ernest, that these ups and downs of
talk are terribly agitating to papa; he could stand whatever comes,
but it is quite too wearing to him to think half-a-dozen different things
backwards and forwards, up and down in the same twenty-four hours, and
it would be kinder of you not to do it&mdash;I mean not to say anything
to him even though Dr Martin does hold out hopes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte had meant to imply that it was Ernest who was at the bottom
of all the inconvenience felt by Theobald, herself, Joey and everyone
else, and she had actually got words out which should convey this; true,
she had not dared to stick to them and had turned them off, but she
had made them hers at any rate for one brief moment, and this was better
than nothing.&nbsp; Ernest noticed throughout his mother&rsquo;s illness,
that Charlotte found immediate occasion to make herself disagreeable
to him whenever either doctor or nurse pronounced her mother to be a
little better.&nbsp; When she wrote to Crampsford to desire the prayers
of the congregation (she was sure her mother would wish it, and that
the Crampsford people would be pleased at her remembrance of them),
she was sending another letter on some quite different subject at the
same time, and put the two letters into the wrong envelopes.&nbsp; Ernest
was asked to take these letters to the village post-office, and imprudently
did so; when the error came to be discovered Christina happened to have
rallied a little.&nbsp; Charlotte flew at Ernest immediately, and laid
all the blame of the blunder upon his shoulders.</p>
<p>Except that Joey and Charlotte were more fully developed, the house
and its inmates, organic and inorganic, were little changed since Ernest
had last seen them.&nbsp; The furniture and the ornaments on the chimney-piece
were just as they had been ever since he could remember anything at
all.&nbsp; In the drawing-room, on either side of the fireplace there
hung the Carlo Dolci and the Sassoferrato as in old times; there was
the water colour of a scene on the Lago Maggiore, copied by Charlotte
from an original lent her by her drawing master, and finished under
his direction.&nbsp; This was the picture of which one of the servants
had said that it must be good, for Mr Pontifex had given ten shillings
for the frame.&nbsp; The paper on the walls was unchanged; the roses
were still waiting for the bees; and the whole family still prayed night
and morning to be made &ldquo;truly honest and conscientious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One picture only was removed&mdash;a photograph of himself which
had hung under one of his father and between those of his brother and
sister.&nbsp; Ernest noticed this at prayer time, while his father was
reading about Noah&rsquo;s ark and how they daubed it with slime, which,
as it happened, had been Ernest&rsquo;s favourite text when he was a
boy.&nbsp; Next morning, however, the photograph had found its way back
again, a little dusty and with a bit of the gilding chipped off from
one corner of the frame, but there sure enough it was.&nbsp; I suppose
they put it back when they found how rich he had become.</p>
<p>In the dining-room the ravens were still trying to feed Elijah over
the fireplace; what a crowd of reminiscences did not this picture bring
back!&nbsp; Looking out of the window, there were the flower beds in
the front garden exactly as they had been, and Ernest found himself
looking hard against the blue door at the bottom of the garden to see
if there was rain falling, as he had been used to look when he was a
child doing lessons with his father.</p>
<p>After their early dinner, when Joey and Ernest and their father were
left alone, Theobald rose and stood in the middle of the hearthrug under
the Elijah picture, and began to whistle in his old absent way.&nbsp;
He had two tunes only, one was &ldquo;In my Cottage near a Wood,&rdquo;
and the other was the Easter Hymn; he had been trying to whistle them
all his life, but had never succeeded; he whistled them as a clever
bullfinch might whistle them&mdash;he had got them, but he had not got
them right; he would be a semitone out in every third note as though
reverting to some remote musical progenitor, who had known none but
the Lydian or the Phrygian mode, or whatever would enable him to go
most wrong while still keeping the tune near enough to be recognised.&nbsp;
Theobald stood before the middle of the fire and whistled his two tunes
softly in his own old way till Ernest left the room; the unchangedness
of the external and changedness of the internal he felt were likely
to throw him completely off his balance.</p>
<p>He strolled out of doors into the sodden spinney behind the house,
and solaced himself with a pipe.&nbsp; Ere long he found himself at
the door of the cottage of his father&rsquo;s coachman, who had married
an old lady&rsquo;s maid of his mother&rsquo;s, to whom Ernest had been
always much attached as she also to him, for she had known him ever
since he had been five or six years old.&nbsp; Her name was Susan.&nbsp;
He sat down in the rocking-chair before her fire, and Susan went on
ironing at the table in front of the window, and a smell of hot flannel
pervaded the kitchen.</p>
<p>Susan had been retained too securely by Christina to be likely to
side with Ernest all in a moment.&nbsp; He knew this very well, and
did not call on her for the sake of support, moral or otherwise.&nbsp;
He had called because he liked her, and also because he knew that he
should gather much in a chat with her that he should not be able to
arrive at in any other way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Master Ernest,&rdquo; said Susan, &ldquo;why did you not
come back when your poor papa and mamma wanted you?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
sure your ma has said to me a hundred times over if she has said it
once that all should be exactly as it had been before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest smiled to himself.&nbsp; It was no use explaining to Susan
why he smiled, so he said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the first day or two I thought she never would get over
it; she said it was a judgement upon her, and went on about things as
she had said and done many years ago, before your pa knew her, and I
don&rsquo;t know what she didn&rsquo;t say or wouldn&rsquo;t have said
only I stopped her; she seemed out of her mind like, and said that none
of the neighbours would ever speak to her again, but the next day Mrs
Bushby (her that was Miss Cowey, you know) called, and your ma always
was so fond of her, and it seemed to do her a power o&rsquo; good, for
the next day she went through all her dresses, and we settled how she
should have them altered; and then all the neighbours called for miles
and miles round, and your ma came in here, and said she had been going
through the waters of misery, and the Lord had turned them to a well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh yes, Susan,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;be sure it is
so.&nbsp; Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, Susan,&rsquo; and here
she began to cry again.&nbsp; &lsquo;As for him,&rsquo; she went on,
&lsquo;he has made his bed, and he must lie on it; when he comes out
of prison his pa will know what is best to be done, and Master Ernest
may be thankful that he has a pa so good and so long-suffering.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then when you would not see them, that was a cruel blow to
your ma.&nbsp; Your pa did not say anything; you know your pa never
does say very much unless he&rsquo;s downright waxy for the time; but
your ma took on dreadful for a few days, and I never saw the master
look so black; but, bless you, it all went off in a few days, and I
don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s been much difference in either of
them since then, not till your ma was took ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the night of his arrival he had behaved well at family prayers,
as also on the following morning; his father read about David&rsquo;s
dying injunctions to Solomon in the matter of Shimei, but he did not
mind it.&nbsp; In the course of the day, however, his corns had been
trodden on so many times that he was in a misbehaving humour, on this
the second night after his arrival.&nbsp; He knelt next Charlotte and
said the responses perfunctorily, not so perfunctorily that she should
know for certain that he was doing it maliciously, but so perfunctorily
as to make her uncertain whether he might be malicious or not, and when
he had to pray to be made truly honest and conscientious he emphasised
the &ldquo;truly.&rdquo;&nbsp; I do not know whether Charlotte noticed
anything, but she knelt at some distance from him during the rest of
his stay.&nbsp; He assures me that this was the only spiteful thing
he did during the whole time he was at Battersby.</p>
<p>When he went up to his bedroom, in which, to do them justice, they
had given him a fire, he noticed what indeed he had noticed as soon
as he was shown into it on his arrival, that there was an illuminated
card framed and glazed over his bed with the words, &ldquo;Be the day
weary or be the day long, at last it ringeth to evensong.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He wondered to himself how such people could leave such a card in a
room in which their visitors would have to spend the last hours of their
evening, but he let it alone.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not enough
difference between &lsquo;weary&rsquo; and &lsquo;long&rsquo; to warrant
an &lsquo;or,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I suppose it is all
right.&rdquo;&nbsp; I believe Christina had bought the card at a bazaar
in aid of the restoration of a neighbouring church, and having been
bought it had got to be used&mdash;besides, the sentiment was so touching
and the illumination was really lovely.&nbsp; Anyhow, no irony could
be more complete than leaving it in my hero&rsquo;s bedroom, though
assuredly no irony had been intended.</p>
<p>On the third day after Ernest&rsquo;s arrival Christina relapsed
again.&nbsp; For the last two days she had been in no pain and had slept
a good deal; her son&rsquo;s presence still seemed to cheer her, and
she often said how thankful she was to be surrounded on her death-bed
by a family so happy, so God-fearing, so united, but now she began to
wander, and, being more sensible of the approach of death, seemed also
more alarmed at the thoughts of the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>She ventured more than once or twice to return to the subject of
her sins, and implored Theobald to make quite sure that they were forgiven
her.&nbsp; She hinted that she considered his professional reputation
was at stake; it would never do for his own wife to fail in securing
at any rate a pass.&nbsp; This was touching Theobald on a tender spot;
he winced and rejoined with an impatient toss of the head, &ldquo;But,
Christina, they <i>are</i> forgiven you&rdquo;; and then he entrenched
himself in a firm but dignified manner behind the Lord&rsquo;s prayer.&nbsp;
When he rose he left the room, but called Ernest out to say that he
could not wish it prolonged.</p>
<p>Joey was no more use in quieting his mother&rsquo;s anxiety than
Theobald had been&mdash;indeed he was only Theobald and water; at last
Ernest, who had not liked interfering, took the matter in hand, and,
sitting beside her, let her pour out her grief to him without let or
hindrance.</p>
<p>She said she knew she had not given up all for Christ&rsquo;s sake;
it was this that weighed upon her.&nbsp; She had given up much, and
had always tried to give up more year by year, still she knew very well
that she had not been so spiritually minded as she ought to have been.&nbsp;
If she had, she should probably have been favoured with some direct
vision or communication; whereas, though God had vouchsafed such direct
and visible angelic visits to one of her dear children, yet she had
had none such herself&mdash;nor even had Theobald.</p>
<p>She was talking rather to herself than to Ernest as she said these
words, but they made him open his ears.&nbsp; He wanted to know whether
the angel had appeared to Joey or to Charlotte.&nbsp; He asked his mother,
but she seemed surprised, as though she expected him to know all about
it, then, as if she remembered, she checked herself and said, &ldquo;Ah!
yes&mdash;you know nothing of all this, and perhaps it is as well.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ernest could not of course press the subject, so he never found out
which of his near relations it was who had had direct communication
with an immortal.&nbsp; The others never said anything to him about
it, though whether this was because they were ashamed, or because they
feared he would not believe the story and thus increase his own damnation,
he could not determine.</p>
<p>Ernest has often thought about this since.&nbsp; He tried to get
the facts out of Susan, who he was sure would know, but Charlotte had
been beforehand with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, Master Ernest,&rdquo; said
Susan, when he began to question her, &ldquo;your ma has sent a message
to me by Miss Charlotte as I am not to say nothing at all about it,
and I never will.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course no further questioning was
possible.&nbsp; It had more than once occurred to Ernest that Charlotte
did not in reality believe more than he did himself, and this incident
went far to strengthen his surmises, but he wavered when he remembered
how she had misdirected the letter asking for the prayers of the congregation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said to himself gloomily, &ldquo;she does
believe in it after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Christina returned to the subject of her own want of spiritual-mindedness,
she even harped upon the old grievance of her having eaten black puddings&mdash;true,
she had given them up years ago, but for how many years had she not
persevered in eating them after she had had misgivings about their having
been forbidden!&nbsp; Then there was something that weighed on her mind
that had taken place before her marriage, and she should like&mdash;</p>
<p>Ernest interrupted: &ldquo;My dear mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you
are ill and your mind is unstrung; others can now judge better about
you than you can; I assure you that to me you seem to have been the
most devotedly unselfish wife and mother that ever lived.&nbsp; Even
if you have not literally given up all for Christ&rsquo;s sake, you
have done so practically as far as it was in your power, and more than
this is not required of anyone.&nbsp; I believe you will not only be
a saint, but a very distinguished one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words Christina brightened.&nbsp; &ldquo;You give me hope,
you give me hope,&rdquo; she cried, and dried her eyes.&nbsp; She made
him assure her over and over again that this was his solemn conviction;
she did not care about being a distinguished saint now; she would be
quite content to be among the meanest who actually got into heaven,
provided she could make sure of escaping that awful Hell.&nbsp; The
fear of this evidently was omnipresent with her, and in spite of all
Ernest could say he did not quite dispel it.&nbsp; She was rather ungrateful,
I must confess, for after more than an hour&rsquo;s consolation from
Ernest she prayed for him that he might have every blessing in this
world, inasmuch as she always feared that he was the only one of her
children whom she should never meet in heaven; but she was then wandering,
and was hardly aware of his presence; her mind in fact was reverting
to states in which it had been before her illness.</p>
<p>On Sunday Ernest went to church as a matter of course, and noted
that the ever receding tide of Evangelicalism had ebbed many a stage
lower, even during the few years of his absence.&nbsp; His father used
to walk to the church through the Rectory garden, and across a small
intervening field.&nbsp; He had been used to walk in a tall hat, his
Master&rsquo;s gown, and wearing a pair of Geneva bands.&nbsp; Ernest
noticed that the bands were worn no longer, and lo! greater marvel still,
Theobald did not preach in his Master&rsquo;s gown, but in a surplice.&nbsp;
The whole character of the service was changed; you could not say it
was high even now, for high-church Theobald could never under any circumstances
become, but the old easy-going slovenliness, if I may say so, was gone
for ever.&nbsp; The orchestral accompaniments to the hymns had disappeared
while my hero was yet a boy, but there had been no chanting for some
years after the harmonium had been introduced.&nbsp; While Ernest was
at Cambridge, Charlotte and Christina had prevailed on Theobald to allow
the canticles to be sung; and sung they were to old-fashioned double
chants by Lord Mornington and Dr Dupuis and others.&nbsp; Theobald did
not like it, but he did it, or allowed it to be done.</p>
<p>Then Christina said: &ldquo;My dear, do you know, I really think&rdquo;
(Christina always &ldquo;really&rdquo; thought) &ldquo;that the people
like the chanting very much, and that it will be a means of bringing
many to church who have stayed away hitherto.&nbsp; I was talking about
it to Mrs Goodhew and to old Miss Wright only yesterday, and they <i>quite</i>
agreed with me, but they all said that we ought to chant the &lsquo;Glory
be to the Father&rsquo; at the end of each of the psalms instead of
saying it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Theobald looked black&mdash;he felt the waters of chanting rising
higher and higher upon him inch by inch; but he felt also, he knew not
why, that he had better yield than fight.&nbsp; So he ordered the &ldquo;Glory
be to the Father&rdquo; to be chanted in future, but he did not like
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, mamma dear,&rdquo; said Charlotte, when the battle
was won, &ldquo;you should not call it the &lsquo;Glory be to the Father&rsquo;
you should say &lsquo;Gloria.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, my dear,&rdquo; said Christina, and she said &ldquo;Gloria&rdquo;
for ever after.&nbsp; Then she thought what a wonderfully clever girl
Charlotte was, and how she ought to marry no one lower than a bishop.&nbsp;
By-and-by when Theobald went away for an unusually long holiday one
summer, he could find no one but a rather high-church clergyman to take
his duty.&nbsp; This gentleman was a man of weight in the neighbourhood,
having considerable private means, but without preferment.&nbsp; In
the summer he would often help his brother clergymen, and it was through
his being willing to take the duty at Battersby for a few Sundays that
Theobald had been able to get away for so long.&nbsp; On his return,
however, he found that the whole psalms were being chanted as well as
the Glorias.&nbsp; The influential clergyman, Christina, and Charlotte
took the bull by the horns as soon as Theobald returned, and laughed
it all off; and the clergyman laughed and bounced, and Christina laughed
and coaxed, and Charlotte uttered unexceptionable sentiments, and the
thing was done now, and could not be undone, and it was no use grieving
over spilt milk; so henceforth the psalms were to be chanted, but Theobald
grisled over it in his heart, and he did not like it.</p>
<p>During this same absence what had Mrs Goodhew and old Miss Wright
taken to doing but turning towards the east while repeating the Belief?&nbsp;
Theobald disliked this even worse than chanting.&nbsp; When he said
something about it in a timid way at dinner after service, Charlotte
said, &ldquo;Really, papa dear, you <i>must</i> take to calling it the
&lsquo;Creed&rsquo; and not the &lsquo;Belief&rsquo;&rdquo;; and Theobald
winced impatiently and snorted meek defiance, but the spirit of her
aunts Jane and Eliza was strong in Charlotte, and the thing was too
small to fight about, and he turned it off with a laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;As
for Charlotte,&rdquo; thought Christina, &ldquo;I believe she knows
<i>everything</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Mrs Goodhew and old Miss Wright continued
to turn to the east during the time the Creed was said, and by-and-by
others followed their example, and ere long the few who had stood out
yielded and turned eastward too; and then Theobald made as though he
had thought it all very right and proper from the first, but like it
he did not.&nbsp; By-and-by Charlotte tried to make him say &ldquo;Alleluia&rdquo;
instead of &ldquo;Hallelujah,&rdquo; but this was going too far, and
Theobald turned, and she got frightened and ran away.</p>
<p>And they changed the double chants for single ones, and altered them
psalm by psalm, and in the middle of psalms, just where a cursory reader
would see no reason why they should do so, they changed from major to
minor and from minor back to major; and then they got &ldquo;Hymns Ancient
and Modern,&rdquo; and, as I have said, they robbed him of his beloved
bands, and they made him preach in a surplice, and he must have celebration
of the Holy Communion once a month instead of only five times in the
year as heretofore, and he struggled in vain against the unseen influence
which he felt to be working in season and out of season against all
that he had been accustomed to consider most distinctive of his party.&nbsp;
Where it was, or what it was, he knew not, nor exactly what it would
do next, but he knew exceedingly well that go where he would it was
undermining him; that it was too persistent for him; that Christina
and Charlotte liked it a great deal better than he did, and that it
could end in nothing but Rome.&nbsp; Easter decorations indeed!&nbsp;
Christmas decorations&mdash;in reason&mdash;were proper enough, but
Easter decorations! well, it might last his time.</p>
<p>This was the course things had taken in the Church of England during
the last forty years.&nbsp; The set has been steadily in one direction.&nbsp;
A few men who knew what they wanted made cats&rsquo; paws of the Christmas
and the Charlottes, and the Christmas and the Charlottes made cats&rsquo;
paws of the Mrs Goodhews and the old Miss Wrights, and Mrs Goodhews
and old Miss Wrights told the Mr Goodhews and young Miss Wrights what
they should do, and when the Mr Goodhews and the young Miss Wrights
did it the little Goodhews and the rest of the spiritual flock did as
they did, and the Theobalds went for nothing; step by step, day by day,
year by year, parish by parish, diocese by diocese this was how it was
done.&nbsp; And yet the Church of England looks with no friendly eyes
upon the theory of Evolution or Descent with Modification.</p>
<p>My hero thought over these things, and remembered many a <i>ruse</i>
on the part of Christina and Charlotte, and many a detail of the struggle
which I cannot further interrupt my story to refer to, and he remembered
his father&rsquo;s favourite retort that it could only end in Rome.&nbsp;
When he was a boy he had firmly believed this, but he smiled now as
he thought of another alternative clear enough to himself, but so horrible
that it had not even occurred to Theobald&mdash;I mean the toppling
over of the whole system.&nbsp; At that time he welcomed the hope that
the absurdities and unrealities of the Church would end in her downfall.&nbsp;
Since then he has come to think very differently, not as believing in
the cow jumping over the moon more than he used to, or more, probably,
than nine-tenths of the clergy themselves&mdash;who know as well as
he does that their outward and visible symbols are out of date&mdash;but
because he knows the baffling complexity of the problem when it comes
to deciding what is actually to be done.&nbsp; Also, now that he has
seen them more closely, he knows better the nature of those wolves in
sheep&rsquo;s clothing, who are thirsting for the blood of their victim,
and exulting so clamorously over its anticipated early fall into their
clutches.&nbsp; The spirit behind the Church is true, though her letter&mdash;true
once&mdash;is now true no longer.&nbsp; The spirit behind the High Priests
of Science is as lying as its letter.&nbsp; The Theobalds, who do what
they do because it seems to be the correct thing, but who in their hearts
neither like it nor believe in it, are in reality the least dangerous
of all classes to the peace and liberties of mankind.&nbsp; The man
to fear is he who goes at things with the cocksureness of pushing vulgarity
and self-conceit.&nbsp; These are not vices which can be justly laid
to the charge of the English clergy.</p>
<p>Many of the farmers came up to Ernest when service was over, and
shook hands with him.&nbsp; He found every one knew of his having come
into a fortune.&nbsp; The fact was that Theobald had immediately told
two or three of the greatest gossips in the village, and the story was
not long in spreading.&nbsp; &ldquo;It simplified matters,&rdquo; he
had said to himself, &ldquo;a good deal.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ernest was civil
to Mrs Goodhew for her husband&rsquo;s sake, but he gave Miss Wright
the cut direct, for he knew that she was only Charlotte in disguise.</p>
<p>A week passed slowly away.&nbsp; Two or three times the family took
the sacrament together round Christina&rsquo;s death-bed.&nbsp; Theobald&rsquo;s
impatience became more and more transparent daily, but fortunately Christina
(who even if she had been well would have been ready to shut her eyes
to it) became weaker and less coherent in mind also, so that she hardly,
if at all, perceived it.&nbsp; After Ernest had been in the house about
a week his mother fell into a comatose state which lasted a couple of
days, and in the end went away so peacefully that it was like the blending
of sea and sky in mid-ocean upon a soft hazy day when none can say where
the earth ends and the heavens begin.&nbsp; Indeed she died to the realities
of life with less pain than she had waked from many of its illusions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has been the comfort and mainstay of my life for more
than thirty years,&rdquo; said Theobald as soon as all was over, &ldquo;but
one could not wish it prolonged,&rdquo; and he buried his face in his
handkerchief to conceal his want of emotion.</p>
<p>Ernest came back to town the day after his mother&rsquo;s death,
and returned to the funeral accompanied by myself.&nbsp; He wanted me
to see his father in order to prevent any possible misapprehension about
Miss Pontifex&rsquo;s intentions, and I was such an old friend of the
family that my presence at Christina&rsquo;s funeral would surprise
no one.&nbsp; With all her faults I had always rather liked Christina.&nbsp;
She would have chopped Ernest or any one else into little pieces of
mincemeat to gratify the slightest wish of her husband, but she would
not have chopped him up for any one else, and so long as he did not
cross her she was very fond of him.&nbsp; By nature she was of an even
temper, more willing to be pleased than ruffled, very ready to do a
good-natured action, provided it did not cost her much exertion, nor
involve expense to Theobald.&nbsp; Her own little purse did not matter;
any one might have as much of that as he or she could get after she
had reserved what was absolutely necessary for her dress.&nbsp; I could
not hear of her end as Ernest described it to me without feeling very
compassionate towards her, indeed her own son could hardly have felt
more so; I at once, therefore, consented to go down to the funeral;
perhaps I was also influenced by a desire to see Charlotte and Joey,
in whom I felt interested on hearing what my godson had told me.</p>
<p>I found Theobald looking remarkably well.&nbsp; Every one said he
was bearing it so beautifully.&nbsp; He did indeed once or twice shake
his head and say that his wife had been the comfort and mainstay of
his life for over thirty years, but there the matter ended.&nbsp; I
stayed over the next day which was Sunday, and took my departure on
the following morning after having told Theobald all that his son wished
me to tell him.&nbsp; Theobald asked me to help him with Christina&rsquo;s
epitaph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would say,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as little as possible;
eulogies of the departed are in most cases both unnecessary and untrue.&nbsp;
Christina&rsquo;s epitaph shall contain nothing which shall be either
the one or the other.&nbsp; I should give her name, the dates of her
birth and death, and of course say she was my wife, and then I think
I should wind up with a simple text&mdash;her favourite one for example,
none indeed could be more appropriate, &lsquo;Blessed are the pure in
heart for they shall see God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said I thought this would be very nice, and it was settled.&nbsp;
So Ernest was sent to give the order to Mr Prosser, the stonemason in
the nearest town, who said it came from &ldquo;the Beetitudes.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXXIV</h2>
<p>On our way to town Ernest broached his plans for spending the next
year or two.&nbsp; I wanted him to try and get more into society again,
but he brushed this aside at once as the very last thing he had a fancy
for.&nbsp; For society indeed of all sorts, except of course that of
a few intimate friends, he had an unconquerable aversion.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
always did hate those people,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and they always
have hated and always will hate me.&nbsp; I am an Ishmael by instinct
as much as by accident of circumstances, but if I keep out of society
I shall be less vulnerable than Ishmaels generally are.&nbsp; The moment
a man goes into society, he becomes vulnerable all round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was very sorry to hear him talk in this way; for whatever strength
a man may have he should surely be able to make more of it if he act
in concert than alone.&nbsp; I said this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;whether I make
the most of my strength or not; I don&rsquo;t know whether I have any
strength, but if I have I dare say it will find some way of exerting
itself.&nbsp; I will live as I like living, not as other people would
like me to live; thanks to my aunt and you I can afford the luxury of
a quiet unobtrusive life of self-indulgence,&rdquo; said he laughing,
&ldquo;and I mean to have it.&nbsp; You know I like writing,&rdquo;
he added after a pause of some minutes, &ldquo;I have been a scribbler
for years.&nbsp; If I am to come to the fore at all it must be by writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had already long since come to that conclusion myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;there are a lot of things
that want saying which no one dares to say, a lot of shams which want
attacking, and yet no one attacks them.&nbsp; It seems to me that I
can say things which not another man in England except myself will venture
to say, and yet which are crying to be said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;But who will listen?&nbsp; If you say things which
nobody else would dare to say is not this much the same as saying what
everyone except yourself knows to be better left unsaid just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know it;
I am bursting with these things, and it is my fate to say them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew there would be no stopping him, so I gave in and asked what
question he felt a special desire to burn his fingers with in the first
instance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marriage,&rdquo; he rejoined promptly, &ldquo;and the power
of disposing of his property after a man is dead.&nbsp; The question
of Christianity is virtually settled, or if not settled there is no
lack of those engaged in settling it.&nbsp; The question of the day
now is marriage and the family system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said I drily, &ldquo;is a hornet&rsquo;s nest
indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he no less drily, &ldquo;but hornet&rsquo;s
nests are exactly what I happen to like.&nbsp; Before, however, I begin
to stir up this particular one I propose to travel for a few years,
with the especial object of finding out what nations now existing are
the best, comeliest and most lovable, and also what nations have been
so in times past.&nbsp; I want to find out how these people live, and
have lived, and what their customs are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have very vague notions upon the subject as yet, but the
general impression I have formed is that, putting ourselves on one side,
the most vigorous and amiable of known nations are the modern Italians,
the old Greeks and Romans, and the South Sea Islanders.&nbsp; I believe
that these nice peoples have not as a general rule been purists, but
I want to see those of them who can yet be seen; they are the practical
authorities on the question&mdash;What is best for man? and I should
like to see them and find out what they do.&nbsp; Let us settle the
fact first and fight about the moral tendencies afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; said I laughingly, &ldquo;you mean to have
high old times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither higher nor lower,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;than
those people whom I can find to have been the best in all ages.&nbsp;
But let us change the subject.&rdquo;&nbsp; He put his hand into his
pocket and brought out a letter.&nbsp; &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;gave me this letter this morning with the seal already broken.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He passed it over to me, and I found it to be the one which Christina
had written before the birth of her last child, and which I have given
in an earlier chapter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you do not find this letter,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;affect
the conclusion which you have just told me you have come to concerning
your present plans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled, and answered: &ldquo;No.&nbsp; But if you do what you
have sometimes talked about and turn the adventures of my unworthy self
into a novel, mind you print this letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; said I, feeling as though such a letter as
this should have been held sacred from the public gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because my mother would have wished it published; if she had
known you were writing about me and had this letter in your possession,
she would above all things have desired that you should publish it.&nbsp;
Therefore publish it if you write at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is why I have done so.</p>
<p>Within a month Ernest carried his intention into effect, and having
made all the arrangements necessary for his children&rsquo;s welfare
left England before Christmas.</p>
<p>I heard from him now and again and learnt that he was visiting almost
all parts of the world, but only staying in those places where he found
the inhabitants unusually good-looking and agreeable.&nbsp; He said
he had filled an immense quantity of note-books, and I have no doubt
he had.&nbsp; At last in the spring of 1867 he returned, his luggage
stained with the variation of each hotel advertisement &rsquo;twixt
here and Japan.&nbsp; He looked very brown and strong, and so well favoured
that it almost seemed as if he must have caught some good looks from
the people among whom he had been living.&nbsp; He came back to his
old rooms in the Temple, and settled down as easily as if he had never
been away a day.</p>
<p>One of the first things we did was to go and see the children; we
took the train to Gravesend, and walked thence for a few miles along
the riverside till we came to the solitary house where the good people
lived with whom Ernest had placed them.&nbsp; It was a lovely April
morning, but with a fresh air blowing from off the sea; the tide was
high, and the river was alive with shipping coming up with wind and
tide.&nbsp; Sea-gulls wheeled around us overhead, sea-weed clung everywhere
to the banks which the advancing tide had not yet covered, everything
was of the sea sea-ey, and the fine bracing air which blew over the
water made me feel more hungry than I had done for many a day; I did
not see how children could live in a better physical atmosphere than
this, and applauded the selection which Ernest had made on behalf of
his youngsters.</p>
<p>While we were still a quarter of a mile off we heard shouts and children&rsquo;s
laughter, and could see a lot of boys and girls romping together and
running after one another.&nbsp; We could not distinguish our own two,
but when we got near they were soon made out, for the other children
were blue-eyed, flaxen-pated little folks, whereas ours were dark and
straight-haired.</p>
<p>We had written to say that we were coming, but had desired that nothing
should be said to the children, so these paid no more attention to us
than they would have done to any other stranger, who happened to visit
a spot so unfrequented except by sea-faring folk, which we plainly were
not.&nbsp; The interest, however, in us was much quickened when it was
discovered that we had got our pockets full of oranges and sweeties,
to an extent greater than it had entered into their small imaginations
to conceive as possible.&nbsp; At first we had great difficulty in making
them come near us.&nbsp; They were like a lot of wild young colts, very
inquisitive, but very coy and not to be cajoled easily.&nbsp; The children
were nine in all&mdash;five boys and two girls belonging to Mr and Mrs
Rollings, and two to Ernest.&nbsp; I never saw a finer lot of children
than the young Rollings, the boys were hardy, robust, fearless little
fellows with eyes as clear as hawks; the elder girl was exquisitely
pretty, but the younger one was a mere baby.&nbsp; I felt as I looked
at them, that if I had had children of my own I could have wished no
better home for them, nor better companions.</p>
<p>Georgie and Alice, Ernest&rsquo;s two children, were evidently quite
as one family with the others, and called Mr and Mrs Rollings uncle
and aunt.&nbsp; They had been so young when they were first brought
to the house that they had been looked upon in the light of new babies
who had been born into the family.&nbsp; They knew nothing about Mr
and Mrs Rollings being paid so much a week to look after them.&nbsp;
Ernest asked them all what they wanted to be.&nbsp; They had only one
idea; one and all, Georgie among the rest, wanted to be bargemen.&nbsp;
Young ducks could hardly have a more evident hankering after the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you want, Alice?&rdquo; said Ernest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to marry Jack
here, and be a bargeman&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was the eldest boy, now nearly twelve, a sturdy little fellow,
the image of what Mr Rollings must have been at his age.&nbsp; As we
looked at him, so straight and well grown and well done all round, I
could see it was in Ernest&rsquo;s mind as much as in mine that she
could hardly do much better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, Jack, my boy,&rdquo; said Ernest, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s
a shilling for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The boy blushed and could hardly be
got to come in spite of our previous blandishments; he had had pennies
given him before, but shillings never.&nbsp; His father caught him good-naturedly
by the ear and lugged him to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good boy, Jack is,&rdquo; said Ernest to Mr Rollings,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr Rollings, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a werry good
boy, only that I can&rsquo;t get him to learn his reading and writing.&nbsp;
He don&rsquo;t like going to school, that&rsquo;s the only complaint
I have against him.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the matter
with all my children, and yours, Mr Pontifex, is just as bad, but they
none of &rsquo;em likes book learning, though they learn anything else
fast enough.&nbsp; Why, as for Jack here, he&rsquo;s almost as good
a bargeman as I am.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he looked fondly and patronisingly
towards his offspring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Ernest to Mr Rollings, &ldquo;if he wants
to marry Alice when he gets older he had better do so, and he shall
have as many barges as he likes.&nbsp; In the meantime, Mr Rollings,
say in what way money can be of use to you, and whatever you can make
useful is at your disposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I need hardly say that Ernest made matters easy for this good couple;
one stipulation, however, he insisted on, namely, there was to be no
more smuggling, and that the young people were to be kept out of this;
for a little bird had told Ernest that smuggling in a quiet way was
one of the resources of the Rollings family.&nbsp; Mr Rollings was not
sorry to assent to this, and I believe it is now many years since the
coastguard people have suspected any of the Rollings family as offenders
against the revenue law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I take them from where they are,&rdquo; said Ernest
to me in the train as we went home, &ldquo;to send them to schools where
they will not be one half so happy, and where their illegitimacy will
very likely be a worry to them?&nbsp; Georgie wants to be a bargeman,
let him begin as one, the sooner the better; he may as well begin with
this as with anything else; then if he shows developments I can be on
the look-out to encourage them and make things easy for him; while if
he shows no desire to go ahead, what on earth is the good of trying
to shove him forward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest, I believe, went on with a homily upon education generally,
and upon the way in which young people should go through the embryonic
stages with their money as much as with their limbs, beginning life
in a much lower social position than that in which their parents were,
and a lot more, which he has since published; but I was getting on in
years, and the walk and the bracing air had made me sleepy, so ere we
had got past Greenhithe Station on our return journey I had sunk into
a refreshing sleep.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXXV</h2>
<p>Ernest being about two and thirty years old and having had his fling
for the last three or four years, now settled down in London, and began
to write steadily.&nbsp; Up to this time he had given abundant promise,
but had produced nothing, nor indeed did he come before the public for
another three or four years yet.</p>
<p>He lived as I have said very quietly, seeing hardly anyone but myself,
and the three or four old friends with whom I had been intimate for
years.&nbsp; Ernest and we formed our little set, and outside of this
my godson was hardly known at all.</p>
<p>His main expense was travelling, which he indulged in at frequent
intervals, but for short times only.&nbsp; Do what he would he could
not get through more than about fifteen hundred a year; the rest of
his income he gave away if he happened to find a case where he thought
money would be well bestowed, or put by until some opportunity arose
of getting rid of it with advantage.</p>
<p>I knew he was writing, but we had had so many little differences
of opinion upon this head that by a tacit understanding the subject
was seldom referred to between us, and I did not know that he was actually
publishing till one day he brought me a book and told me flat it was
his own.&nbsp; I opened it and found it to be a series of semi-theological,
semi-social essays, purporting to have been written by six or seven
different people, and viewing the same class of subjects from different
standpoints.</p>
<p>People had not yet forgotten the famous &ldquo;Essays and Reviews,&rdquo;
and Ernest had wickedly given a few touches to at least two of the essays
which suggested vaguely that they had been written by a bishop.&nbsp;
The essays were all of them in support of the Church of England, and
appeared both by internal suggestion, and their prima facie purport
to be the work of some half-dozen men of experience and high position
who had determined to face the difficult questions of the day no less
boldly from within the bosom of the Church than the Church&rsquo;s enemies
had faced them from without her pale.</p>
<p>There was an essay on the external evidences of the Resurrection;
another on the marriage laws of the most eminent nations of the world
in times past and present; another was devoted to a consideration of
the many questions which must be reopened and reconsidered on their
merits if the teaching of the Church of England were to cease to carry
moral authority with it; another dealt with the more purely social subject
of middle class destitution; another with the authenticity or rather
the unauthenticity of the fourth gospel&mdash;another was headed &ldquo;Irrational
Rationalism,&rdquo; and there were two or three more.</p>
<p>They were all written vigorously and fearlessly as though by people
used to authority; all granted that the Church professed to enjoin belief
in much which no one could accept who had been accustomed to weigh evidence;
but it was contended that so much valuable truth had got so closely
mixed up with these mistakes, that the mistakes had better not be meddled
with.&nbsp; To lay great stress on these was like cavilling at the Queen&rsquo;s
right to reign, on the ground that William the Conqueror was illegitimate.</p>
<p>One article maintained that though it would be inconvenient to change
the words of our prayer book and articles, it would not be inconvenient
to change in a quiet way the meanings which we put upon those words.&nbsp;
This, it was argued, was what was actually done in the case of law;
this had been the law&rsquo;s mode of growth and adaptation, and had
in all ages been found a righteous and convenient method of effecting
change.&nbsp; It was suggested that the Church should adopt it.</p>
<p>In another essay it was boldly denied that the Church rested upon
reason.&nbsp; It was proved incontestably that its ultimate foundation
was and ought to be faith, there being indeed no other ultimate foundation
than this for any of man&rsquo;s beliefs.&nbsp; If so, the writer claimed
that the Church could not be upset by reason.&nbsp; It was founded,
like everything else, on initial assumptions, that is to say on faith,
and if it was to be upset it was to be upset by faith, by the faith
of those who in their lives appeared more graceful, more lovable, better
bred, in fact, and better able to overcome difficulties.&nbsp; Any sect
which showed its superiority in these respects might carry all before
it, but none other would make much headway for long together.&nbsp;
Christianity was true in so far as it had fostered beauty, and it had
fostered much beauty.&nbsp; It was false in so far as it fostered ugliness,
and it had fostered much ugliness.&nbsp; It was therefore not a little
true and not a little false; on the whole one might go farther and fare
worse; the wisest course would be to live with it, and make the best
and not the worst of it.&nbsp; The writer urged that we become persecutors
as a matter of course as soon as we begin to feel very strongly upon
any subject; we ought not therefore to do this; we ought not to feel
very strongly&mdash;even upon that institution which was dearer to the
writer than any other&mdash;the Church of England.&nbsp; We should be
churchmen, but somewhat lukewarm churchmen, inasmuch as those who care
very much about either religion or irreligion are seldom observed to
be very well bred or agreeable people.&nbsp; The Church herself should
approach as nearly to that of Laodicea as was compatible with her continuing
to be a Church at all, and each individual member should only be hot
in striving to be as lukewarm as possible.</p>
<p>The book rang with the courage alike of conviction and of an entire
absence of conviction; it appeared to be the work of men who had a rule-of-thumb
way of steering between iconoclasm on the one hand and credulity on
the other; who cut Gordian knots as a matter of course when it suited
their convenience; who shrank from no conclusion in theory, nor from
any want of logic in practice so long as they were illogical of malice
prepense, and for what they held to be sufficient reason.&nbsp; The
conclusions were conservative, quietistic, comforting.&nbsp; The arguments
by which they were reached were taken from the most advanced writers
of the day.&nbsp; All that these people contended for was granted them,
but the fruits of victory were for the most part handed over to those
already in possession.</p>
<p>Perhaps the passage which attracted most attention in the book was
one from the essay on the various marriage systems of the world.&nbsp;
It ran:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If people require us to construct,&rdquo; exclaimed the writer,
&ldquo;we set good breeding as the corner-stone of our edifice.&nbsp;
We would have it ever present consciously or unconsciously in the minds
of all as the central faith in which they should live and move and have
their being, as the touchstone of all things whereby they may be known
as good or evil according as they make for good breeding or against
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That a man should have been bred well and breed others well;
that his figure, head, hands, feet, voice, manner and clothes should
carry conviction upon this point, so that no one can look at him without
seeing that he has come of good stock and is likely to throw good stock
himself, this is the <i>desiderandum</i>.&nbsp; And the same with a
woman.&nbsp; The greatest number of these well-bred men and women, and
the greatest happiness of these well-bred men and women, this is the
highest good; towards this all government, all social conventions, all
art, literature and science should directly or indirectly tend.&nbsp;
Holy men and holy women are those who keep this unconsciously in view
at all times whether of work or pastime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Ernest had published this work in his own name I should think
it would have fallen stillborn from the press, but the form he had chosen
was calculated at that time to arouse curiosity, and as I have said
he had wickedly dropped a few hints which the reviewers did not think
anyone would have been impudent enough to do if he were not a bishop,
or at any rate some one in authority.&nbsp; A well-known judge was spoken
of as being another of the writers, and the idea spread ere long that
six or seven of the leading bishops and judges had laid their heads
together to produce a volume, which should at once outbid &ldquo;Essays
and Reviews&rdquo; and counteract the influence of that then still famous
work.</p>
<p>Reviewers are men of like passions with ourselves, and with them
as with everyone else <i>omne ignotum pro magnifico</i>.&nbsp; The book
was really an able one and abounded with humour, just satire, and good
sense.&nbsp; It struck a new note and the speculation which for some
time was rife concerning its authorship made many turn to it who would
never have looked at it otherwise.&nbsp; One of the most gushing weeklies
had a fit over it, and declared it to be the finest thing that had been
done since the &ldquo;Provincial Letters&rdquo; of Pascal.&nbsp; Once
a month or so that weekly always found some picture which was the finest
that had been done since the old masters, or some satire that was the
finest that had appeared since Swift or some something which was incomparably
the finest that had appeared since something else.&nbsp; If Ernest had
put his name to the book, and the writer had known that it was by a
nobody, he would doubtless have written in a very different strain.&nbsp;
Reviewers like to think that for aught they know they are patting a
Duke or even a Prince of the blood upon the back, and lay it on thick
till they find they have been only praising Brown, Jones or Robinson.&nbsp;
Then they are disappointed, and as a general rule will pay Brown, Jones
or Robinson out.</p>
<p>Ernest was not so much up to the ropes of the literary world as I
was, and I am afraid his head was a little turned when he woke up one
morning to find himself famous.&nbsp; He was Christina&rsquo;s son,
and perhaps would not have been able to do what he had done if he was
not capable of occasional undue elation.&nbsp; Ere long, however, he
found out all about it, and settled quietly down to write a series of
books, in which he insisted on saying things which no one else would
say even if they could, or could even if they would.</p>
<p>He has got himself a bad literary character.&nbsp; I said to him
laughingly one day that he was like the man in the last century of whom
it was said that nothing but such a character could keep down such parts.</p>
<p>He laughed and said he would rather be like that than like a modern
writer or two whom he could name, whose parts were so poor that they
could be kept up by nothing but by such a character.</p>
<p>I remember soon after one of these books was published I happened
to meet Mrs Jupp to whom, by the way, Ernest made a small weekly allowance.&nbsp;
It was at Ernest&rsquo;s chambers, and for some reason we were left
alone for a few minutes.&nbsp; I said to her: &ldquo;Mr Pontifex has
written another book, Mrs Jupp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo; now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;has he really?&nbsp;
Dear gentleman!&nbsp; Is it about love?&rdquo;&nbsp; And the old sinner
threw up a wicked sheep&rsquo;s eye glance at me from under her aged
eyelids.&nbsp; I forget what there was in my reply which provoked it&mdash;probably
nothing&mdash;but she went rattling on at full speed to the effect that
Bell had given her a ticket for the opera, &ldquo;So, of course,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;I went.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t understand one word of
it, for it was all French, but I saw their legs.&nbsp; Oh dear, oh dear!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m afraid I shan&rsquo;t be here much longer, and when dear Mr
Pontifex sees me in my coffin he&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;Poor old Jupp,
she&rsquo;ll never talk broad any more&rsquo;; but bless you I&rsquo;m
not so old as all that, and I&rsquo;m taking lessons in dancing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment Ernest came in and the conversation was changed.&nbsp;
Mrs Jupp asked if he was still going on writing more books now that
this one was done.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course I am,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always writing books; here is the manuscript of my
next;&rdquo; and he showed her a heap of paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;dear, dear me, and
is that manuscript?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve often heard talk about manuscripts,
but I never thought I should live to see some myself.&nbsp; Well! well!&nbsp;
So that is really manuscript?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were a few geraniums in the window and they did not look well.&nbsp;
Ernest asked Mrs Jupp if she understood flowers.&nbsp; &ldquo;I understand
the language of flowers,&rdquo; she said, with one of her most bewitching
leers, and on this we sent her off till she should choose to honour
us with another visit, which she knows she is privileged from time to
time to do, for Ernest likes her.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXXVI</h2>
<p>And now I must bring my story to a close.</p>
<p>The preceding chapter was written soon after the events it records&mdash;that
is to say in the spring of 1867.&nbsp; By that time my story had been
written up to this point; but it has been altered here and there from
time to time occasionally.&nbsp; It is now the autumn of 1882, and if
I am to say more I should do so quickly, for I am eighty years old and
though well in health cannot conceal from myself that I am no longer
young.&nbsp; Ernest himself is forty-seven, though he hardly looks it.</p>
<p>He is richer than ever, for he has never married and his London and
North-Western shares have nearly doubled themselves.&nbsp; Through sheer
inability to spend his income he has been obliged to hoard in self-defence.&nbsp;
He still lives in the Temple in the same rooms I took for him when he
gave up his shop, for no one has been able to induce him to take a house.&nbsp;
His house, he says, is wherever there is a good hotel.&nbsp; When he
is in town he likes to work and to be quiet.&nbsp; When out of town
he feels that he has left little behind him that can go wrong, and he
would not like to be tied to a single locality.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know
no exception,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;to the rule that it is cheaper
to buy milk than to keep a cow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I have mentioned Mrs Jupp, I may as well say here the little that
remains to be said about her.&nbsp; She is a very old woman now, but
no one now living, as she says triumphantly, can say how old, for the
woman in the Old Kent Road is dead, and presumably has carried her secret
to the grave.&nbsp; Old, however, though she is, she lives in the same
house, and finds it hard work to make the two ends meet, but I do not
know that she minds this very much, and it has prevented her from getting
more to drink than would be good for her.&nbsp; It is no use trying
to do anything for her beyond paying her allowance weekly, and absolutely
refusing to let her anticipate it.&nbsp; She pawns her flat iron every
Saturday for 4d., and takes it out every Monday morning for 4.5d. when
she gets her allowance, and has done this for the last ten years as
regularly as the week comes round.&nbsp; As long as she does not let
the flat iron actually go we know that she can still worry out her financial
problems in her own hugger-mugger way and had better be left to do so.&nbsp;
If the flat iron were to go beyond redemption, we should know that it
was time to interfere.&nbsp; I do not know why, but there is something
about her which always reminds me of a woman who was as unlike her as
one person can be to another&mdash;I mean Ernest&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>The last time I had a long gossip with her was about two years ago
when she came to me instead of to Ernest.&nbsp; She said she had seen
a cab drive up just as she was going to enter the staircase, and had
seen Mr Pontifex&rsquo;s pa put his Beelzebub old head out of the window,
so she had come on to me, for she hadn&rsquo;t greased her sides for
no curtsey, not for the likes of him.&nbsp; She professed to be very
much down on her luck.&nbsp; Her lodgers did use her so dreadful, going
away without paying and leaving not so much as a stick behind, but to-day
she was as pleased as a penny carrot.&nbsp; She had had such a lovely
dinner&mdash;a cushion of ham and green peas.&nbsp; She had had a good
cry over it, but then she was so silly, she was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s that Bell,&rdquo; she continued, though
I could not detect any appearance of connection, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s enough
to give anyone the hump to see him now that he&rsquo;s taken to chapel-going,
and his mother&rsquo;s prepared to meet Jesus and all that to me, and
now she ain&rsquo;t a-going to die, and drinks half a bottle of champagne
a day, and then Grigg, him as preaches, you know, asked Bell if I really
was too gay, not but what when I was young I&rsquo;d snap my fingers
at any &lsquo;fly by night&rsquo; in Holborn, and if I was togged out
and had my teeth I&rsquo;d do it now.&nbsp; I lost my poor dear Watkins,
but of course that couldn&rsquo;t be helped, and then I lost my dear
Rose.&nbsp; Silly faggot to go and ride on a cart and catch the bronchitics.&nbsp;
I never thought when I kissed my dear Rose in Pullen&rsquo;s Passage
and she gave me the chop, that I should never see her again, and her
gentleman friend was fond of her too, though he was a married man.&nbsp;
I daresay she&rsquo;s gone to bits by now.&nbsp; If she could rise and
see me with my bad finger, she would cry, and I should say, &lsquo;Never
mind, ducky, I&rsquo;m all right.&rsquo;&nbsp; Oh! dear, it&rsquo;s
coming on to rain.&nbsp; I do hate a wet Saturday night&mdash;poor women
with their nice white stockings and their living to get,&rdquo; etc.,
etc.</p>
<p>And yet age does not wither this godless old sinner, as people would
say it ought to do.&nbsp; Whatever life she has led, it has agreed with
her very sufficiently.&nbsp; At times she gives us to understand that
she is still much solicited; at others she takes quite a different tone.&nbsp;
She has not allowed even Joe King so much as to put his lips to hers
this ten years.&nbsp; She would rather have a mutton chop any day.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But ah! you should have seen me when I was sweet seventeen.&nbsp;
I was the very moral of my poor dear mother, and she was a pretty woman,
though I say it that shouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She had such a splendid
mouth of teeth.&nbsp; It was a sin to bury her in her teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I only knew of one thing at which she professes to be shocked.&nbsp;
It is that her son Tom and his wife Topsy are teaching the baby to swear.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s too dreadful awful,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know the meaning of the words, but I tell him he&rsquo;s
a drunken sot.&rdquo;&nbsp; I believe the old woman in reality rather
likes it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely, Mrs Jupp,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Tom&rsquo;s wife
used not to be Topsy.&nbsp; You used to speak of her as Pheeb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! yes,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;but Pheeb behaved bad,
and it&rsquo;s Topsy now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest&rsquo;s daughter Alice married the boy who had been her playmate
more than a year ago.&nbsp; Ernest gave them all they said they wanted
and a good deal more.&nbsp; They have already presented him with a grandson,
and I doubt not, will do so with many more.&nbsp; Georgie though only
twenty-one is owner of a fine steamer which his father has bought for
him.&nbsp; He began when about thirteen going with old Rollings and
Jack in the barge from Rochester to the upper Thames with bricks; then
his father bought him and Jack barges of their own, and then he bought
them both ships, and then steamers.&nbsp; I do not exactly know how
people make money by having a steamer, but he does whatever is usual,
and from all I can gather makes it pay extremely well.&nbsp; He is a
good deal like his father in the face, but without a spark&mdash;so
far as I have been able to observe&mdash;any literary ability; he has
a fair sense of humour and abundance of common sense, but his instinct
is clearly a practical one.&nbsp; I am not sure that he does not put
me in mind almost more of what Theobald would have been if he had been
a sailor, than of Ernest.&nbsp; Ernest used to go down to Battersby
and stay with his father for a few days twice a year until Theobald&rsquo;s
death, and the pair continued on excellent terms, in spite of what the
neighbouring clergy call &ldquo;the atrocious books which Mr Ernest
Pontifex&rdquo; has written.&nbsp; Perhaps the harmony, or rather absence
of discord which subsisted between the pair was due to the fact that
Theobald had never looked into the inside of one of his son&rsquo;s
works, and Ernest, of course, never alluded to them in his father&rsquo;s
presence.&nbsp; The pair, as I have said, got on excellently, but it
was doubtless as well that Ernest&rsquo;s visits were short and not
too frequent.&nbsp; Once Theobald wanted Ernest to bring his children,
but Ernest knew they would not like it, so this was not done.</p>
<p>Sometimes Theobald came up to town on small business matters and
paid a visit to Ernest&rsquo;s chambers; he generally brought with him
a couple of lettuces, or a cabbage, or half-a-dozen turnips done up
in a piece of brown paper, and told Ernest that he knew fresh vegetables
were rather hard to get in London, and he had brought him some.&nbsp;
Ernest had often explained to him that the vegetables were of no use
to him, and that he had rather he would not bring them; but Theobald
persisted, I believe through sheer love of doing something which his
son did not like, but which was too small to take notice of.</p>
<p>He lived until about twelve months ago, when he was found dead in
his bed on the morning after having written the following letter to
his son:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dear Ernest,&mdash;I&rsquo;ve nothing particular
to write about, but your letter has been lying for some days in the
limbo of unanswered letters, to wit my pocket, and it&rsquo;s time it
was answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I keep wonderfully well and am able to walk my five or six
miles with comfort, but at my age there&rsquo;s no knowing how long
it will last, and time flies quickly.&nbsp; I have been busy potting
plants all the morning, but this afternoon is wet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this horrid Government going to do with Ireland?&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t exactly wish they&rsquo;d blow up Mr Gladstone, but if
a mad bull would chivy him there, and he would never come back any more,
I should not be sorry.&nbsp; Lord Hartington is not exactly the man
I should like to set in his place, but he would be immeasurably better
than Gladstone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I miss your sister Charlotte more than I can express.&nbsp;
She kept my household accounts, and I could pour out to her all little
worries, and now that Joey is married too, I don&rsquo;t know what I
should do if one or other of them did not come sometimes and take care
of me.&nbsp; My only comfort is that Charlotte will make her husband
happy, and that he is as nearly worthy of her as a husband can well
be.&mdash;Believe me, Your affectionate father,</p>
<p>&ldquo;THEOBALD PONTIFEX.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I may say in passing that though Theobald speaks of Charlotte&rsquo;s
marriage as though it were recent, it had really taken place some six
years previously, she being then about thirty-eight years old, and her
husband about seven years younger.</p>
<p>There was no doubt that Theobald passed peacefully away during his
sleep.&nbsp; Can a man who died thus be said to have died at all?&nbsp;
He has presented the phenomena of death to other people, but in respect
of himself he has not only not died, but has not even thought that he
was going to die.&nbsp; This is not more than half dying, but then neither
was his life more than half living.&nbsp; He presented so many of the
phenomena of living that I suppose on the whole it would be less trouble
to think of him as having been alive than as never having been born
at all, but this is only possible because association does not stick
to the strict letter of its bond.</p>
<p>This, however, was not the general verdict concerning him, and the
general verdict is often the truest.</p>
<p>Ernest was overwhelmed with expressions of condolence and respect
for his father&rsquo;s memory.&nbsp; &ldquo;He never,&rdquo; said Dr
Martin, the old doctor who brought Ernest into the world, &ldquo;spoke
an ill word against anyone.&nbsp; He was not only liked, he was beloved
by all who had anything to do with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A more perfectly just and righteously dealing man,&rdquo;
said the family solicitor, &ldquo;I have never had anything to do with&mdash;nor
one more punctual in the discharge of every business obligation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall miss him sadly,&rdquo; the bishop wrote to Joey in
the very warmest terms.&nbsp; The poor were in consternation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The well&rsquo;s never missed,&rdquo; said one old woman, &ldquo;till
it&rsquo;s dry,&rdquo; and she only said what everyone else felt.&nbsp;
Ernest knew that the general regret was unaffected as for a loss which
could not be easily repaired.&nbsp; He felt that there were only three
people in the world who joined insincerely in the tribute of applause,
and these were the very three who could least show their want of sympathy.&nbsp;
I mean Joey, Charlotte, and himself.&nbsp; He felt bitter against himself
for being of a mind with either Joey or Charlotte upon any subject,
and thankful that he must conceal his being so as far as possible, not
because of anything his father had done to him&mdash;these grievances
were too old to be remembered now&mdash;but because he would never allow
him to feel towards him as he was always trying to feel.&nbsp; As long
as communication was confined to the merest commonplace all went well,
but if these were departed from ever such a little he invariably felt
that his father&rsquo;s instincts showed themselves in immediate opposition
to his own.&nbsp; When he was attacked his father laid whatever stress
was possible on everything which his opponents said.&nbsp; If he met
with any check his father was clearly pleased.&nbsp; What the old doctor
had said about Theobald&rsquo;s speaking ill of no man was perfectly
true as regards others than himself, but he knew very well that no one
had injured his reputation in a quiet way, so far as he dared to do,
more than his own father.&nbsp; This is a very common case and a very
natural one.&nbsp; It often happens that if the son is right, the father
is wrong, and the father is not going to have this if he can help it.</p>
<p>It was very hard, however, to say what was the true root of the mischief
in the present case.&nbsp; It was not Ernest&rsquo;s having been imprisoned.&nbsp;
Theobald forgot all about that much sooner than nine fathers out of
ten would have done.&nbsp; Partly, no doubt, it was due to incompatibility
of temperament, but I believe the main ground of complaint lay in the
fact that he had been so independent and so rich while still very young,
and that thus the old gentleman had been robbed of his power to tease
and scratch in the way which he felt he was entitled to do.&nbsp; The
love of teasing in a small way when he felt safe in doing so had remained
part of his nature from the days when he told his nurse that he would
keep her on purpose to torment her.&nbsp; I suppose it is so with all
of us.&nbsp; At any rate I am sure that most fathers, especially if
they are clergymen, are like Theobald.</p>
<p>He did not in reality, I am convinced, like Joey or Charlotte one
whit better than he liked Ernest.&nbsp; He did not like anyone or anything,
or if he liked anyone at all it was his butler, who looked after him
when he was not well, and took great care of him and believed him to
be the best and ablest man in the whole world.&nbsp; Whether this faithful
and attached servant continued to think this after Theobald&rsquo;s
will was opened and it was found what kind of legacy had been left him
I know not.&nbsp; Of his children, the baby who had died at a day old
was the only one whom he held to have treated him quite filially.&nbsp;
As for Christina he hardly ever pretended to miss her and never mentioned
her name; but this was taken as a proof that he felt her loss too keenly
to be able ever to speak of her.&nbsp; It may have been so, but I do
not think it.</p>
<p>Theobald&rsquo;s effects were sold by auction, and among them the
Harmony of the Old and New Testaments which he had compiled during many
years with such exquisite neatness and a huge collection of MS. sermons&mdash;being
all in fact that he had ever written.&nbsp; These and the Harmony fetched
ninepence a barrow load.&nbsp; I was surprised to hear that Joey had
not given the three or four shillings which would have bought the whole
lot, but Ernest tells me that Joey was far fiercer in his dislike of
his father than ever he had been himself, and wished to get rid of everything
that reminded him of him.</p>
<p>It has already appeared that both Joey and Charlotte are married.&nbsp;
Joey has a family, but he and Ernest very rarely have any intercourse.&nbsp;
Of course, Ernest took nothing under his father&rsquo;s will; this had
long been understood, so that the other two are both well provided for.</p>
<p>Charlotte is as clever as ever, and sometimes asks Ernest to come
and stay with her and her husband near Dover, I suppose because she
knows that the invitation will not be agreeable to him.&nbsp; There
is a <i>de haut en bas</i> tone in all her letters; it is rather hard
to lay one&rsquo;s finger upon it but Ernest never gets a letter from
her without feeling that he is being written to by one who has had direct
communication with an angel.&nbsp; &ldquo;What an awful creature,&rdquo;
he once said to me, &ldquo;that angel must have been if it had anything
to do with making Charlotte what she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you like,&rdquo; she wrote to him not long ago, &ldquo;the
thoughts of a little sea change here?&nbsp; The top of the cliffs will
soon be bright with heather: the gorse must be out already, and the
heather I should think begun, to judge by the state of the hill at Ewell,
and heather or no heather&mdash;the cliffs are always beautiful, and
if you come your room shall be cosy so that you may have a resting corner
to yourself.&nbsp; Nineteen and sixpence is the price of a return-ticket
which covers a month.&nbsp; Would you decide just as you would yourself
like, only if you come we would hope to try and make it bright for you;
but you must not feel it a burden on your mind if you feel disinclined
to come in this direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I have a bad nightmare,&rdquo; said Ernest to me, laughing
as he showed me this letter, &ldquo;I dream that I have got to stay
with Charlotte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her letters are supposed to be unusually well written, and I believe
it is said among the family that Charlotte has far more real literary
power than Ernest has.&nbsp; Sometimes we think that she is writing
at him as much as to say, &ldquo;There now&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think
you are the only one of us who can write; read this!&nbsp; And if you
want a telling bit of descriptive writing for your next book, you can
make what use of it you like.&rdquo;&nbsp; I daresay she writes very
well, but she has fallen under the dominion of the words &ldquo;hope,&rdquo;
&ldquo;think,&rdquo; &ldquo;feel,&rdquo; &ldquo;try,&rdquo; &ldquo;bright,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;little,&rdquo; and can hardly write a page without introducing
all these words and some of them more than once.&nbsp; All this has
the effect of making her style monotonous.</p>
<p>Ernest is as fond of music as ever, perhaps more so, and of late
years has added musical composition to the other irons in his fire.&nbsp;
He finds it still a little difficult, and is in constant trouble through
getting into the key of C sharp after beginning in the key of C and
being unable to get back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting into the key of C sharp,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is
like an unprotected female travelling on the Metropolitan Railway, and
finding herself at Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush, without quite knowing where
she wants to go to.&nbsp; How is she ever to get safe back to Clapham
Junction?&nbsp; And Clapham Junction won&rsquo;t quite do either, for
Clapham Junction is like the diminished seventh&mdash;susceptible of
such enharmonic change, that you can resolve it into all the possible
termini of music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talking of music reminds me of a little passage that took place between
Ernest and Miss Skinner, Dr Skinner&rsquo;s eldest daughter, not so
very long ago.&nbsp; Dr Skinner had long left Roughborough, and had
become Dean of a Cathedral in one of our Midland counties&mdash;a position
which exactly suited him.&nbsp; Finding himself once in the neighbourhood
Ernest called, for old acquaintance sake, and was hospitably entertained
at lunch.</p>
<p>Thirty years had whitened the Doctor&rsquo;s bushy eyebrows&mdash;his
hair they could not whiten.&nbsp; I believe that but for that wig he
would have been made a bishop.</p>
<p>His voice and manner were unchanged, and when Ernest remarking upon
a plan of Rome which hung in the hall, spoke inadvertently of the Quirinal,
he replied with all his wonted pomp: &ldquo;Yes, the QuirInal&mdash;or
as I myself prefer to call it, the QuirInal.&rdquo;&nbsp; After this
triumph he inhaled a long breath through the corners of his mouth, and
flung it back again into the face of Heaven, as in his finest form during
his head-mastership.&nbsp; At lunch he did indeed once say, &ldquo;next
to impossible to think of anything else,&rdquo; but he immediately corrected
himself and substituted the words, &ldquo;next to impossible to entertain
irrelevant ideas,&rdquo; after which he seemed to feel a good deal more
comfortable.&nbsp; Ernest saw the familiar volumes of Dr Skinner&rsquo;s
works upon the bookshelves in the Deanery dining-room, but he saw no
copy of &ldquo;Rome or the Bible&mdash;Which?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you still as fond of music as ever, Mr Pontifex?&rdquo;
said Miss Skinner to Ernest during the course of lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of some kinds of music, yes, Miss Skinner, but you know I
never did like modern music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that rather dreadful?&mdash;Don&rsquo;t you think
you rather&rdquo;&mdash;she was going to have added, &ldquo;ought to?&rdquo;
but she left it unsaid, feeling doubtless that she had sufficiently
conveyed her meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like modern music, if I could; I have been trying
all my life to like it, but I succeed less and less the older I grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pray, where do you consider modern music to begin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Sebastian Bach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you like Beethoven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I used to think I did, when I was younger, but I know
now that I never really liked him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! how can you say so?&nbsp; You cannot understand him, you
never could say this if you understood him.&nbsp; For me a simple chord
of Beethoven is enough.&nbsp; This is happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernest was amused at her strong family likeness to her father&mdash;a
likeness which had grown upon her as she had become older, and which
extended even to voice and manner of speaking.&nbsp; He remembered how
he had heard me describe the game of chess I had played with the doctor
in days gone by, and with his mind&rsquo;s ear seemed to hear Miss Skinner
saying, as though it were an epitaph:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Stay:<br />
I may presently take<br />
A simple chord of Beethoven,<br />
Or a small semiquaver<br />
From one of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s Songs without Words.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After luncheon when Ernest was left alone for half an hour or so
with the Dean he plied him so well with compliments that the old gentleman
was pleased and flattered beyond his wont.&nbsp; He rose and bowed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;These expressions,&rdquo; he said, <i>voce su&acirc;</i>, &ldquo;are
very valuable to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They are but a small part,
Sir,&rdquo; rejoined Ernest, &ldquo;of what anyone of your old pupils
must feel towards you,&rdquo; and the pair danced as it were a minuet
at the end of the dining-room table in front of the old bay window that
looked upon the smooth shaven lawn.&nbsp; On this Ernest departed; but
a few days afterwards, the Doctor wrote him a letter and told him that
his critics were a &sigma;&kappa;&lambda;&eta;&rho;&omicron;&iota; &kappa;&alpha;&iota;
&alpha;&nu;&tau;&iota;&tau;&upsilon;&pi;&omicron;&iota;, and at the
same time &alpha;&nu;&epsilon;&kappa;&pi;&lambda;&eta;&kappa;&tau;&omicron;&iota;.&nbsp;
Ernest remembered &sigma;&kappa;&lambda;&eta;&rho;&omicron;&iota;, and
knew that the other words were something of like nature, so it was all
right.&nbsp; A month or two afterwards, Dr Skinner was gathered to his
fathers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was an old fool, Ernest,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and you
should not relent towards him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not help it,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;he was so old
that it was almost like playing with a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes, like all whose minds are active, Ernest overworks himself,
and then occasionally he has fierce and reproachful encounters with
Dr Skinner or Theobald in his sleep&mdash;but beyond this neither of
these two worthies can now molest him further.</p>
<p>To myself he has been a son and more than a son; at times I am half
afraid&mdash;as for example when I talk to him about his books&mdash;that
I may have been to him more like a father than I ought; if I have, I
trust he has forgiven me.&nbsp; His books are the only bone of contention
between us.&nbsp; I want him to write like other people, and not to
offend so many of his readers; he says he can no more change his manner
of writing than the colour of his hair, and that he must write as he
does or not at all.</p>
<p>With the public generally he is not a favourite.&nbsp; He is admitted
to have talent, but it is considered generally to be of a queer unpractical
kind, and no matter how serious he is, he is always accused of being
in jest.&nbsp; His first book was a success for reasons which I have
already explained, but none of his others have been more than creditable
failures.&nbsp; He is one of those unfortunate men, each one of whose
books is sneered at by literary critics as soon as it comes out, but
becomes &ldquo;excellent reading&rdquo; as soon as it has been followed
by a later work which may in its turn be condemned.</p>
<p>He never asked a reviewer to dinner in his life.&nbsp; I have told
him over and over again that this is madness, and find that this is
the only thing I can say to him which makes him angry with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can it matter to me,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;whether people
read my books or not?&nbsp; It may matter to them&mdash;but I have too
much money to want more, and if the books have any stuff in them it
will work by-and-by.&nbsp; I do not know nor greatly care whether they
are good or not.&nbsp; What opinion can any sane man form about his
own work?&nbsp; Some people must write stupid books just as there must
be junior ops and third class poll men.&nbsp; Why should I complain
of being among the mediocrities?&nbsp; If a man is not absolutely below
mediocrity let him be thankful&mdash;besides, the books will have to
stand by themselves some day, so the sooner they begin the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I spoke to his publisher about him not long since.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr
Pontifex,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is a <i>homo unius libri</i>, but it
doesn&rsquo;t do to tell him so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could see the publisher, who ought to know, had lost all faith
in Ernest&rsquo;s literary position, and looked upon him as a man whose
failure was all the more hopeless for the fact of his having once made
a <i>coup</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is in a very solitary position, Mr Overton,&rdquo;
continued the publisher.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has formed no alliances, and
has made enemies not only of the religious world but of the literary
and scientific brotherhood as well.&nbsp; This will not do nowadays.&nbsp;
If a man wishes to get on he must belong to a set, and Mr Pontifex belongs
to no set&mdash;not even to a club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I replied, &ldquo;Mr Pontifex is the exact likeness of Othello, but
with a difference&mdash;he hates not wisely but too well.&nbsp; He would
dislike the literary and scientific swells if he were to come to know
them and they him; there is no natural solidarity between him and them,
and if he were brought into contact with them his last state would be
worse than his first.&nbsp; His instinct tells him this, so he keeps
clear of them, and attacks them whenever he thinks they deserve it&mdash;in
the hope, perhaps, that a younger generation will listen to him more
willingly than the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can anything,&rdquo;&rsquo; said the publisher, &ldquo;be
conceived more impracticable and imprudent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To all this Ernest replies with one word only&mdash;&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such is my friend&rsquo;s latest development.&nbsp; He would not,
it is true, run much chance at present of trying to found a College
of Spiritual Pathology, but I must leave the reader to determine whether
there is not a strong family likeness between the Ernest of the College
of Spiritual Pathology and the Ernest who will insist on addressing
the next generation rather than his own.&nbsp; He says he trusts that
there is not, and takes the sacrament duly once a year as a sop to Nemesis
lest he should again feel strongly upon any subject.&nbsp; It rather
fatigues him, but &ldquo;no man&rsquo;s opinions,&rdquo; he sometimes

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
